A defining moment
may shape the direction of an institution for decades to come.  In the modern history of the
Federal Reserve, the action it took on October 6, 1979, stands out as such a
milestone and arguably as a turning point in our nation's economic history.ï¿½ The
policy change initiated under the leadership of Chairman Paul Volcker on that
Saturday morning in Washington rescued our nation's economy from a dangerous path
of ever-escalating inflation and instability.ï¿½ As I noted in congressional
testimony before the Joint Economic Committee on November 5 of that year:

We are here ï¿½ to evaluate the moves of
Chairman Volcker and his colleagues last month, implying that some alternate
policies were feasible at that time.ï¿½ However, given the state of the world
financial markets, had the Fed not opted to initiate a sharp interest rate
increase in this country, the market would have done it for us.1

In a democratic
society such as ours, the central bank is entrusted by the Congress, and
ultimately by the citizenry, with the tremendous responsibility of guarding the
purchasing power of money. ï¿½It is now generally recognized that price stability
is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and,
indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment
over time.ï¿½ But the importance of price stability has sometimes been insufficiently
appreciated in our central bank's history, and, as Allan Meltzer will soon
point out, such episodes have had unfortunate consequences.ï¿½

Far from being a
bulwark of stability in the 1970s, the Federal Reserve conducted policies that,
in the judgment of many analysts, inadvertently contributed to an environment
of macroeconomic instability. ï¿½We should strive to retain in the collective
memory of our institution the ensuing lessons of that period.ï¿½ It may be the
most fruitful and proper way to commemorate the events of October a
quarter-century ago.

Tracing the roots
of the 1970s inflation brings us to an earlier era.ï¿½ The Keynesian revolution
of the 1930s and its subsequent empirical application led many economists to
accept the view that through regulation, state intervention, and the macroeconomic
management of aggregate demand, government policies, including those of our nation's
central bank, could improve on earlier efforts to achieve and maintain ï¿½full
employment.ï¿½ï¿½ By the 1960s, policymakers seemed to concentrate their short-run
objectives on maintaining a ï¿½high pressureï¿½ economy in the belief that such a
recipe could virtually thwart economic contractions at little or no risk to
long-run stability and growth. ï¿½If this high-pressure management inadvertently carried
the economy beyond its productive potential, some cost in terms of inflation
could be expected, but such costs appeared tolerable in light of the employment
gains that came with them.ï¿½ Furthermore, policymakers hoped that additional
tools at their disposal--so-called incomes policies enforced by ï¿½jawboning,ï¿½
guideposts, and price and wage controls--were ready to combat and control any
resulting upcreep in inflation with minimal macroeconomic cost.  By the turn of the 1970s, the ugly
reality of stagflation forced an overhaul of this policy framework.ï¿½ The
corrosive influence of inflation on our nation's productive potential was
beginning to take hold.ï¿½ Policymakers slowly came to recognize the adverse
long-term consequences of compromising the purchasing power of our currency for
economic well being.ï¿½ï¿½ Indeed, by the late 1970s, a consensus gradually emerged
that inflation destroyed jobs rather than facilitating their creation.ï¿½
Unfortunately, a legacy of failed attempts during the decade to restore
stability with gradualist plans and with various incarnations of incomes
policies took its toll on business and household attitudes toward inflation and
toward the prospects of our nation.ï¿½ By the end of the decade, an inflationary
psychology had become well entrenched and complicated efforts to restore a
sense of stability in the national psyche.ï¿½

Little leeway for
policy was left before the Federal Reserve took decisive action on October 6, 1979.ï¿½ In retrospect, the policy put in place on that day was the obvious and
necessary solution to the nation's troubles.ï¿½ As events unfolded, however, the
Federal Reserve did not escape criticism, and for a time it was not entirely
obvious that the System could maintain the necessary public support to see its
disinflationary efforts come to fruition.ï¿½ Though widely anticipated even
before the actions of October, the recession and retrenchment in employment
that followed those actions resulted in pressures on the Federal Reserve to
reverse course.ï¿½ The fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of the Great
Depression--the crash of 1929--was observed later during that same month,
October 1979.ï¿½ I recall that this anniversary not only rekindled the question
of whether such an event could recur but also inflamed sensitivities regarding
the effects on unemployment that might stem from the new anti-inflationary
action.ï¿½ Judging from the fate of earlier attempts during the 1970s to tame
inflation in the face of a weakening economy, when short-run considerations
appeared to trump policies oriented toward longer horizons, such fears of
rising unemployment could have also derailed the reforms of October.ï¿½ In the
event, they did not.ï¿½ We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Chairman Volcker
and to the Federal Open Market Committee for their leadership and steadfastness
on that important occasion and for restoring the publicï¿½s faith in our nation's
currency.

By the time that I
arrived at the Federal Reserve, in 1987, the task of the Federal Open Market
Committee had become easier precisely because of the perseverance and success
of our predecessors in the turbulent years following October 1979.ï¿½ Maintaining
an environment of stability is simpler than restoring the publicï¿½s faith in the
soundness of our currency.ï¿½ The task is easier still as we remind ourselves of
the stark difference between the long-term prospects of our economy now, in our
current environment of stability, and then, a quarter-century ago, before the
reforms of that October.

[SECTION]

In closing, I
applaud President Poole and his colleagues for organizing this event to reflect
upon that critical episode in our nationï¿½s economic history.ï¿½ An appreciation
of our history is, after all, an invaluable guide to sound policies for a
better future.
