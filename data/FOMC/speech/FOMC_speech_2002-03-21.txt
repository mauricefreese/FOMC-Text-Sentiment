Current Challenges of Community Banks

[SECTION]

Good morning.  I am delighted to be here to discuss a variety of issues that I believe are relevant today to directors and senior managers of banks.  During my brief term on the Board, I have heard other governors say that they came to Washington expecting to spend most of their time discussing the economy and monetary policy with many of the Board's 225 PhD. economists and then making policy decisions and judgments.  Although those activities are, in fact, an important part of the job, my colleagues have typically found that they spend significantly more time on bank supervisory and regulatory matters.  I suspect that will be my experience as well, and--as a former banker--I look forward to dealing with these issues from the other side of the table.  As I do so, I'm sure I will benefit greatly from opportunities like this one to meet with industry participants.
