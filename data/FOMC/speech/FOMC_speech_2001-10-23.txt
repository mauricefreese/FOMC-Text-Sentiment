Preparing for CRA 2002

[SECTION]

Thank you for inviting me to this colloquium.  It is important for experts and practitioners to discuss the central issues concerning the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).

[SECTION]

CRA has been an important feature of the financial landscape for twenty-five years now.  It was originally passed when banks were more dominant in the financial world, but also smaller and more localized.  But a financial revolution has taken place over the past quarter century.  Banks have become bigger, more national, and yet a smaller part of the overall financial landscape.  We've witnessed the growth of financial holding companies, multinational financial enterprises, and nonbank lending companies.  CRA has been modified to keep pace with the changing times, and CRA lending has grown sharply over time.

[SECTION]

This evolution has many fascinating aspects.  But I will focus on only one--the upcoming 2002 review of the CRA regulations.  As you may know, when the four banking regulatory agencies re-wrote the CRA regulations in 1995, they agreed to review them again in 2002 to determine whether the revisions provided a more realistic approach to evaluating an institution's CRA performance than the previous regulations did, or whether they should be modified in other ways.  We made that commitment to ensure that the CRA regulations continue to achieve the results embodied in the original goals of the reform effort--emphasis on actual performance and consistency and elimination of unnecessary burden.

[SECTION]

This summer's joint interagency advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) marked the beginning of this process.  This first public comment period for the ANPR has now ended and the agencies are considering the comments and whether specific changes to the CRA regulations are warranted.  If changes are deemed necessary, the next steps will be the issuance of draft regulations, another comment period, and final regulations, presumably all occurring next year.

[SECTION]

Today I will offer my perspectives on the challenging path that lies ahead. Obviously my remarks should not be interpreted as suggesting that we have made decisions, even tentative decisions.  Rather, this discussion is intended to describe the various forces at play in the financial services sector that will influence how the regulations might be revised.

Background

By way of background, some in Congress seem to view CRA as an obligation that financial institutions take on as a payback for deposit insurance.  Hence, CRA has always and still does cover all federally insured depository institutions except  credit unions.  Regulators examine how well an institution has helped meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, at regular intervals.  Large institutions--generally those with assets greater than $250 million or that belong to a holding company with greater than $1 billion of total assets--are rated under lending, investment, and service tests.  The lending test evaluates loans originated or purchased by the institution in its assessment area.  The investment test relates to the institution's participation in grants and equity-type investments, with a primary purpose of community development.  The service test refers primarily to the provision of services through branches and other community development activities.

As we sort through these and other questions, I offer two important precepts that I think we should keep in mind:

[SECTION]

Do No Harm

Over the years, the core focus of the CRA regulations has remained intact--financial institutions have an obligation to help meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income groups in their communities.  CRA has provided the necessary incentive for financial institutions to explore partnerships with civic and community groups in order to focus investment on distressed or underserved communities.   CRA has brought a heightened awareness of lending gaps, has led institutions to discover untapped market potential in underserved communities, and has encouraged the creation of loan products and financial services that allow low- and moderate-income borrowers greater access to credit and financial products.  Whatever we do, we should not sacrifice these advantages.

[SECTION]

Avoid a "One Size Fits All" Approach

We can never write regulations that work perfectly in all situations.  We have to maintain the appropriate balance between quantitative and qualitative measurements.  We should adapt to changing times and consider new forces in financial markets that influence the ability of institutions to meet the credit needs of their communities.  These points remind us that we must always be mindful of important differences among institutions and the communities they serve.  Our regulations should be consistent across the country, but also flexible enough to deal with individual circumstances.

[SECTION]

These issues may prove difficult, but they challenge us to think critically about the development of local communities and the role that CRA plays in that process.  Our goal is to adopt regulations that promote fair and impartial access to credit and financial services and enhance opportunities for growth in underserved markets.  I look forward to receiving your views as we continue to craft regulations to promote effective community reinvestment and fair lending.
