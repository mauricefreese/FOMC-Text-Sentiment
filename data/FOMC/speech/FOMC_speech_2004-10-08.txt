Panel discussion: Safeguarding Good Policy Practice through Maintaining Flexibility

[SECTION]



[SECTION]

I am pleased to
address this conference commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the historic
monetary policy changes implemented in October 1979. In my prepared remarks, I
would like to focus on two issues with respect to safeguarding good monetary
policy practice. First, I will discuss what constitutes good monetary policy
practice and review the Federal Reserve's record in satisfying its mandates in
recent decades. Then, I will speculate on how good policy outcomes come about.
In particular, I will discuss the role of policy transparency, central bank leadership,
and alternative monetary policy regimes in preserving effective monetary policy.
Of course, the usual caveat to my remarks applies: I will express my own
views, and you should not interpret them as the position of the Federal Open
Market Committee or of the Board of Governors.

[SECTION]

Assessing the Federal Reserve's Performance after 1979
When assessing what
constitutes good monetary policy practice, I prefer to focus not on theory but
on the reality of the Federal Reserve's objectives. In contrast to many other
central banks, the Federal Reserve has been assigned a "dual mandate"--to
pursue policies that both maintain price stability and achieve maximum
sustainable economic growth and employment. Good policy practice can be judged
by the outcomes achieved. Therefore, I would like to briefly outline the
Federal Reserve's performance with respect to the level and the variability of
inflation and growth. To be sure, the strong economic performance over the
past two decades has several possible explanations, but the practice of monetary
policy has likely contributed by helping to preserve macroeconomic stability.

[SECTION]

With respect to
price stability, inflation in the United States over the past decade or so has clearly
been lower and more stable than it was earlier in our history. In fact, annual
inflation in the price index of personal consumption expenditures excluding
food and energy--core PCE--averaged just over 2 percent from 1990 through the
end of last year and consistently remained within a range--roughly 1 to 4
percent--that is relatively narrow compared with historical experience. This period
contrasts sharply to the fourteen-year period from 1965 through the end of 1979,
when annual core-PCE inflation averaged just over 5 percent and fluctuated between
3 and 10 percent. The recent experience of the United States with inflation has
been similar in some respects and dissimilar in others to that of other
countries. For example, based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development's measures of overall consumer price inflation, prices rose at
an annual average rate of about 3 percent in the United States from 1990 through
2003, compared with about 3 percent in the euro area and in the United Kingdom
and roughly 1 percent in Japan.1
But, more important, the volatility of inflation was lower in the United States
than in these other economies.

[SECTION]

An equally
important indicator of the success of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is
private expectations for future inflation. Measures of inflation expectations obtained
from financial asset prices clearly indicate that market participants expect that
the Federal Reserve will maintain low and stable inflation. For example,
although the difference between the yields on nominal inflation-indexed and
Treasury securities is an imperfect measure that includes complicating factors
such as inflation risk and liquidity premiums, the five-year break-even
inflation rate five years ahead has averaged about 2-1/2 percent over the past
five years and has fluctuated in a narrow range of about 1-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent.
Survey measures confirm that inflation expectations over this period have been
subdued and well anchored. The University of Michigan's survey of ten-year
inflation expectations has averaged less than 3 percent and has stayed within a
very narrow range over the past five years.

[SECTION]

Assessing the
outcomes with respect to the Federal Reserve's goal of maximum sustainable
output growth is inherently more difficult. Estimates of the relevant
measures, such as the nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU),
which in recent years has been decreasing according to some estimates, have
very wide confidence intervals. But we can point to some evidence suggesting
that the United States has enjoyed, besides subdued and stable inflation, some
favorable developments with respect to output and employment. Certainly, we
can document substantial gains in productivity in recent decades in the United
  States. According to the OECD, business sector labor productivity growth in
the United States averaged about 2 percent from 1990 through the end of 2003,
compared with about 1-1/2 percent in the euro area and in Japan over the same
period. And since the mid-1990s, this gap has widened, with annual
productivity growth averaging about 2-1/2 percent since 1995 in the United
  States, compared with about 1-1/2 percent in Japan and just less than 1
percent in the euro area over the same period.2

[SECTION]

Another important measure
of the success of monetary policy is how well the FOMC has responded to threats
to our nation's financial stability. This claim is surely hard to quantify. But
everyone would agree that, compared especially with the deleterious effects of
the Federal Reserve's policy response during the Great Depression, the Fed has responded
effectively to more-recent crises so as to help minimize the impact of such
shocks on the greater economy. These episodes include the stock market crash
of October 1987, the Asian financial crisis, and the collapse of Long-Term
Capital Management in the late 1990s. Thanks in no small part to the
flexibility of our policy framework, which I will discuss in greater detail in
a few moments, the Federal Reserve appropriately discharged its responsibility
as lender of last resort by providing ample liquidity and ensuring confidence during
these and other troubling episodes, including the aftermath of the terrorist
attacks of September 11, 2001.

[SECTION]

There is greater
disagreement about how well the Federal Reserve responded to the bursting in
recent years of the so-called bubble in technology stocks. This topic is broad,
but I would like to note that, as many of my colleagues and I have previously argued,
prospectively addressing perceived asset-price bubbles is a matter of such
great uncertainty that, even with the benefit of hindsight, it is not clear
that policy decisions in the late 1990s, for example, should have been any
different. In any case, the recession that followed the sharp decline in stock
prices was shallow by historical standards.

[SECTION]

How Can We Safeguard Good Policy Outcomes?
I would now like
to turn to issues related to preserving, as best we can, a continuation of good
policy practice in the future.

[SECTION]

Central Bank Transparency
Consider first the
important role of central bank transparency. Transparency of central bank
decisionmaking is desirable, not only for economic reasons, but also because it
is supportive of central bank independence within a democratic society. Because
of the lagged effects of monetary policy on output and prices, the time horizon
of central bankers is necessarily more distant than that of other policymakers.
Thus, the central bank needs substantial insulation from political pressures to
execute policy: An independent monetary authority is less tempted to make
policy for the short term, such as boosting output or refinancing national
budgets, at the expense of long-run objectives. Of course, the goals of
monetary policy should be determined within the democratic process, but the
central bank should have discretion to achieve those ends. In short, an
appropriate arrangement within democratic societies is for central banks to have
independence with respect to the instruments, but not the goals of monetary
policy, and transparency is an appropriate condition for that independence.

[SECTION]

Besides its
inherent virtues in a democratic society, transparency can enhance monetary policy's
economic effectiveness by more closely aligning financial market forces with central
bankers' intentions. Like other central banks, the Federal Reserve controls
only a very short-term interest rate, the overnight federal funds rate. However,
theory and empirical evidence suggest that longer-term interest rates and
conditions in other financial markets, which reflect expectations for
short-term rates, matter most for monetary policy transmission to the economy.
If the monetary authority is transparent about the rationale and the stance of
policy as well as its perception of the economic outlook, then investors can
improve their expectations of future short rates.3

[SECTION]

The path that
monetary policy will follow in the future is uncertain even to policymakers because
that trajectory will depend on incoming news about the economy and the
implications of that news for the economic outlook. But announcing policy decisions
in a timely manner and explaining those decisions fully allows market
participants to better anticipate the response of policy to unexpected
developments and to speed needed financial adjustments.

[SECTION]

Central Bank Leadership
Next, I consider
the role of the individuals entrusted with the responsibility for making policy
decisions. Although monetary policy frameworks have a potentially great
influence on macroeconomic outcomes, we should not forget that the individuals
who serve in central banks themselves have a crucial role in preserving policy
outcomes. Even with a monetary policy regime that follows best practices and
shapes the decisionmaking process, ultimately individuals' beliefs and
perceptions still matter for the actual policy taken.

[SECTION]

An interesting recent
study of the history of the Federal Reserve by Christina Romer and David Romer finds
a very strong link between the skill and knowledge of the FOMC, particularly
the Chairman, and macroeconomic outcomes.4
For example, with little reference to transformations in the disclosure policy
and the independence of the Federal Reserve over the years, they ascribe the
policy successes of two periods--the 1950s and the 1980s and 1990s--to a
conviction of Federal Reserve Chairmen regarding the high costs of inflation
and their tempered views about the sustainable levels of output and
employment. In contrast, they attribute the deflationary and counterproductive
policies of the 1930s to the erroneous belief that monetary policy can do
little to stimulate output and that the economy can actually overheat at low levels
of capacity utilization.

[SECTION]

But there is one
aspect of the process that Romer and Romer do not emphasize enough--the ability
of central bankers in general, and indeed members of the FOMC in particular, to
withstand political pressures. In addition, central bankers should have a
thorough and practical, rather than a purely academic, understanding of the
economy and, given the Federal Reserve's objective to preserve financial
stability, of financial markets and institutions.

[SECTION]

The committee's institutional
memory may also matter in this context. Today, the FOMC is well versed in the
monetary history of the 1970s and 1980s, for example, and recognizes the great
efforts that previous members of the FOMC undertook to achieve price
stability. I trust that future generations of policymakers will continue to
share that understanding and thus help to preserve good policy outcomes.

[SECTION]

Will Inflation Targets Preserve Good Policy Practice?
Finally, I would
like to touch on a topic that is perhaps more controversial in the context of
safeguarding good policy practice. Several academic and professional economists,
including distinguished colleagues of mine at this conference, have eloquently
advocated the adoption of explicit numerical goals for central bank objectives,
most notably inflation targets. The adoption of numerical targets, it is
argued, facilitates central bank accountability and better anchors private
expectations about inflation and monetary policy and thereby yields better
macroeconomic outcomes.

[SECTION]

Quantifying
central bank objectives has some positive aspects and, certainly, vigorous
advocates. Nonetheless, I harbor significant reservations about this approach regarding
both its practical implementation, in the specific context of the Federal
Reserve System, and its demonstrated effectiveness based on inferences from the
recent experience of regimes that have specific numerical targets, particularly
with respect to inflation, around the world.

[SECTION]

A basic, yet
difficult, issue is the selection of a particular price index to guide policy,
even in the case of a single goal such as inflation. Experience tells us that
economies and the composition of productive enterprises change over time, and
therefore the appropriate index and inflation value for the monetary authority would
also need to change to reflect technological and other advances. In light of
this inherent uncertainty associated with the construction of a price index, one
might be concerned that choosing and rigidly adhering to an inappropriate index
could have negative economic consequences that might outweigh prospective
benefits.

[SECTION]

Also, we must
consider the ramifications of quantified goals in the context of our
democracy. That is, the quantification of objectives becomes even more
problematic for central banks such as the Federal Reserve with multiple democratically
based mandates, some of which are notably less disposed to quantification than
others. For example, considering our dual mandate from the Congress, how do we
measure maximum sustainable employment? Indeed, as I mentioned previously, estimates
of the NAIRU and other possible related measures that address the
full-employment objective such as the output gap have uncomfortably wide confidence
intervals and are far more controversial than selecting a target for a specific
price index.

[SECTION]

Of course, the
central bank could in principle quantify only the inflation objective. However,
I fear that quantifying one goal and not the other would present problems
because the monetary authority might inadvertently place more emphasis on the
quantified goal at the expense of the nonquantified objective. Doing so would
seem inappropriate. The ease of quantification should not influence how the
Federal Reserve pursues its dual mandate.

[SECTION]

In addition, I
worry about the potential loss of flexibility from the implementation of an
inflation target, as explicit numerical goals might inhibit the central bank's
focus on output variation or financial stability. I would argue that, besides the
episodes of financial turmoil in the late 1990s mentioned earlier, supply
shocks, such as large increases in oil prices that simultaneously increase the
price level and decrease aggregate output, can be problematic for inflation-targeting
regimes.

[SECTION]

Of course, some
variants of the approach--so-called flexible inflation targeting for instance--can
address the issues I just raised by stipulating wide target ranges, by maintaining
escape clauses that allow inflation to diverge from the target, or by aiming at
average inflation over the business cycle. But the credibility gains from
inflation targeting seem to me to be inversely related to its flexibility.
Simply, credibility is less likely to be gained and expectations are less
likely to be anchored if the central bank frequently uses escape clauses,
widens the target bands, or pushes out its time horizon.

[SECTION]

Ultimately, real
credibility for achieving goals must come from performance, and predetermined
frameworks do not seem to be a necessary or a sufficient condition to safeguard
desirable policy outcomes. Observation of more-recent Federal Reserve actions
reveals the apparent preferences of policymakers. In recent years, the Federal
Reserve has apparently leaned against disinflation when core inflation
threatens to fall much below 1 percent, and, similarly, against inflation when the
core rate threatens to rise above 2 to 2-1/2 percent. The Federal Reserve has
demonstrated this strategy without the formal adoption of a specific inflation
target or range for the FOMC.

[SECTION]

Given the subdued
and stable inflation witnessed over the past fourteen years, I have to ask: What
would be gained from a formal goal for inflation? Can we draw compelling general
inferences from the recent experience of inflation-targeting central banks? As
a caveat regarding this evidence, economists have very limited data to work
with, as the first recognizable inflation targeting regime appeared in New
  Zealand in 1990. But to date, I would argue that the case for inflation
targeting has yet to be proved.

[SECTION]

Certainly, I would
not deny that numerical inflation targets have proven useful for several
countries in particular circumstances. One example is the United Kingdom,
where, in the aftermath of "Black Wednesday" in October 1992, an
inflation target helped provide a nominal anchor after sterling was removed
from the European exchange rate mechanism. I should also add that the Bank of
England has quite successfully helped to achieve low and stable inflation ever
since. In addition, inflation targeting can have demonstrable benefits in
lower-income countries that have experienced high and variable inflation rates
in the recent past.

[SECTION]

In several cases, quantified
inflation targeting has served as a means of achieving the central bank
independence necessary to focus more effectively on controlling inflation. That
is, the adoption of an inflation target is frequently part of a broader program
to increase the autonomy and transparency of central bank practice. But
inflation targeting is not the only means by which to achieve these ends.
Again, the recent experience in the United States that I have noted is an
object lesson in this regard.

[SECTION]

Unfortunately, the
empirical evidence for industrial countries available to date generally appears
insufficient to assess the success of the inflation-targeting approach with
confidence. For example, it is unclear whether the announcement of
quantitative inflation targets lessens the short-run tradeoff between
employment and inflation, and whether it helps anchor inflation expectations. In
addition, some research, controlling for other factors, fails to isolate the
benefits of an inflation target with respect to the level of inflation or its
volatility over time, and output does not seem to fluctuate more stably around
its potential for countries that have adopted numerical targets.5
Future data may or may not produce compelling evidence, but I maintain that the
case today for inflation targets in countries that already enjoy low and stable
inflation rates has certainly not been proved.

[SECTION]

With respect to
both its practical implementation, particularly in the United States, and the
empirical evidence to date, I submit that the adoption of a numerical inflation
target does not promise any obvious incremental benefits, at least in countries
that have already achieved reasonable price stability. That said, a continuing
commitment to price stability is certainly important, and the Federal Reserve
has established a solid record of such commitment.

[SECTION]

Conclusion
Based on this
brief review, I conclude that, at least since the policy reform of October
1979, most observers would agree that the Federal Reserve has achieved
generally good policy practice and outcomes. In my assessment, good policy
practice cannot be safeguarded with certainty using a single rule or framework,
such as inflation targeting. Good outcomes ultimately depend on flexible
execution of an evolving strategy and policymakers with an unwavering
commitment to low and stable inflation as the foundation for maximum
sustainable growth.
