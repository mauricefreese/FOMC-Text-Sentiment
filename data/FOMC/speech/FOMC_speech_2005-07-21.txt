Monetary Policy Perspectives 
        on Risk Premiums in Financial Markets

[SECTION]

I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this conference 
        on the time variation and macroeconomic links of financial market risk 
        premiums. Steven Sharpe, Paul Harrison, and Hao Zhou are to be congratulated 
        for putting together an interesting program that should advance our understanding 
        of this important topic. Although your papers concentrate on the equity 
        premium, I would like to take a few minutes today to broaden the discussion 
        to encompass risk premiums in other markets and to highlight the connections 
        between risk premiums and monetary policy. My goal is not to draw conclusions 
        on recent movements in risk premiums but rather to give you a sense of 
        how estimates of risk premiums may influence our policy decisionmaking, 
        to note some of the difficulties that we face in interpreting their movements, 
        and, I hope, to stimulate further research in this already fertile field.1

[SECTION]

At the Federal Reserve, we pay a lot of attention to financial market 
        prices in the formulation of monetary policy. Financial markets are the 
        channel through which our policy affects the economy, and asset prices 
        contain valuable information about investors' expectations for the 
        course of policy, economic activity, and inflation, as well as about the 
        risks around those expectations.

[SECTION]

An important element in interpreting financial market prices is the 
        identification of the risk premiums they contain. To be clear, when I 
        say "risk premium" I mean the additional compensation required by investors 
        for holding a risky security--that is, one with uncertain returns--above 
        the compensation that would be demanded by risk-neutral investors who 
        care only about expected returns. For example, while a risk-neutral investor 
        would demand a certain spread on a junk bond over a risk-free rate of 
        the same maturity as compensation for expected losses, a risk-averse investor 
        likely requires an even wider spread depending on the covariance characteristics 
        of the bond's total return. In the Treasury market, risk--or term--premiums 
        are generally evident as maturities extend and reflect mostly the interaction 
        of risk aversion and uncertainty about the future path of interest rates. 
        When applied to credit markets, the term "risk premium" is sometimes used 
        in a broader sense to include expected losses, but I am thinking of risk 
        premiums as the extra compensation for the uncertainty around anticipated 
        economic and financial outcomes. This compensation is determined by both 
        perception of risks and investor preferences, or risk aversion.

[SECTION]

Among the risk premiums that we monitor regularly at the Federal Reserve 
        are those on equity returns, equity volatility, corporate bonds, and Treasury 
        securities. Each contains information about a different risk around a 
        different expected outcome. Clearly, the separation of market prices into 
        distinct pieces reflecting expected values and risk is a difficult task 
        that relies heavily on modeling assumptions about underlying processes 
        and investor behavior. Indeed, think of all the constituents of, say, 
        a long-term corporate bond yield. Such a yield encompasses compensation 
        for expected real rates, for expected inflation, for expected default, 
        and for the expected liquidity in the instrument, and it contains conceptually 
        separate risk premiums for uncertainty about each of these underlying 
        factors. In principle, an ideal model would account for each of those 
        components separately. In practice, however, we have yet to achieve such 
        a fine breakdown, and the estimate of any one or group of those components 
        is likely to be highly dependent on the estimates of the others. Although 
        some promising research on modeling these components--jointly or individually--is 
        under way, we need to be especially aware of our theoretical and empirical 
        limitations when interpreting market price movements. But these qualifications 
        do not diminish the point that risk premiums are certainly relevant for 
        monetary policy deliberations, and we do pay attention to our best estimates 
        of them.

[SECTION]

We, as policymakers, form our own independent view of the expected path 
        of a number of macroeconomic and financial variables, but we are also 
        obviously interested in gauging investors' expectations about the future 
        paths of those same variables. Investor expectations shape the market 
        reaction to new economic data and to our policy actions, and when those 
        expectations differ from our own, they could embed information that we 
        might wish to factor into our own analysis. Investors' expectations are 
        reflected in asset prices, but so are risk premiums, and inferences about 
        future economic conditions obtained from market prices are conditional 
        on estimates of those premiums. Neglecting or grossly misestimating risk 
        premiums will lead to misperceptions of the market's outlook and thus 
        potentially to market moves that we did not anticipate. Nothing better 
        illustrates the need to properly account for risk premiums than the current 
        interest rate environment: To what extent are long-term interest rates 
        low because investors expect short-term rates to be low in the future 
        due to some underlying softness in aggregate demand, and to what extent 
        do low long rates reflect narrow term premiums, perhaps induced by well-anchored 
        inflation expectations or low macroeconomic volatility? Clearly, the policy 
        implications of these two alternative explanations are very different.

[SECTION]

While judging investors' expectations is important when setting monetary 
        policy, so is understanding investors' sense of the distribution of possible 
        outcomes around those expectations. Market risk premiums may well be an 
        input into our own perceptions of the range of possible economic outcomes, 
        and our policy actions can be influenced by those perceptions. For example, 
        our reaction to a scenario in which inflation is low and is expected to 
        vary within a narrow band would presumably be different than our reaction 
        to an alternative scenario in which inflation uncertainty was high 
        and there was a significant chance of entering a deflationary environment. 
        Thus, we are also interested in risk premiums as indicators of uncertainty 
        and not solely as inputs into accurate readings of investors' mean economic 
        outlook.

[SECTION]

So far I have largely considered risk premiums as indicators of economic 
        conditions, but they can also directly affect real economic activity. 
        For example, the decline in term premiums in the Treasury market of late 
        may have contributed to keeping long-term interest rates relatively low 
        and, consequently, may have supported the housing sector and consumer 
        spending more generally. Also, risk premiums may be, in part, a manifestation 
        of investor sentiment, which in turn may be correlated with consumer and 
        business sentiment. Accordingly, it is possible that risk premiums may 
        reflect broader "animal spirits" in a Keynesian sense, and thus they could 
        be a marker for shifts in underlying business and consumer spending trends. 
        Consider the dramatic example of the turnaround in equity markets from 
        2000 to 2003: The pullback of both real and financial risk-taking that 
        accompanied it surely was a significant drag on the economy. Risk premiums 
        may even have a role in credit cycles: Some research here at the Board 
        has shown that corporate bonds issued when risk premiums are low default 
        at a higher rate than bonds issued when risk premiums are high, even when 
        conditioning on their observable risk.2 Other research has drawn similar 
        underperformance conclusions about stock returns following initial public 
        offerings.3

[SECTION]

Finally, risk premiums are also important tools for monitoring financial 
        stability. A strong, stable financial system is of vital importance both 
        for a robust economy and as a support for an effective monetary policy. 
        Information that bears on investors' attitudes toward risk and on the 
        functioning of financial markets and financial institutions is thus undoubtedly 
        valuable. It certainly was, for example, in the fall of 1998, when virtually 
        every risk premium measure that we monitor appeared to indicate a sharp 
        withdrawal from risk-taking on the part of investors. That withdrawal 
        threatened financial stability and, as a consequence, real activity; the 
        Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) risk-management approach to policy 
        dictated that the target rate be eased enough to substantially reduce 
        the odds on a very adverse outcome.

[SECTION]

As you can see, we read risk premiums in a variety of ways and for a 
        variety of purposes. Because we conduct policy in real time, our attention 
        is often drawn to movements in risk premiums as they occur, especially 
        if they appear to deviate from long-established patterns. Thus, we try 
        first of all to develop a good understanding of the historical behavior 
        of risk premiums. The top panel of the exhibit that I have passed around 
        shows crude estimates, put together by the Board's staff, of the risk 
        premium on both equities and corporate bonds going back to 1920. The equity 
        risk premium is constructed by subtracting the real Aaa corporate yield 
        from the ratio of trend earnings to prices as a measure of expected equity 
        returns. The corporate bond risk premium is constructed as the expected 
        excess rate of return of Baa over Aaa corporate bonds using expected default 
        rates from a simple regression model. The configuration of risk premiums 
        in the 1950s presents both similarities and contrasts to the behavior 
        of risk premiums in current times. That earlier decade, like the present, 
        was a time of low interest rates and low inflation, and the corporate 
        bond risk premium was low, just as it is today. But our estimates suggest 
        that the equity premium for that period was substantially higher than 
        it appears to be today. To an extent, that may have been a manifestation 
        of a lingering reluctance to hold equity for a generation that had been 
        chastened by the Great Depression; asset preferences apparently were skewed 
        in ways that could not be readily attributed to objective differences 
        in the risks of holding credit and equity claims on businesses.

[SECTION]

The other aspect of the chart that stands out is the apparent decline 
        in risk measures since the late 1970s and early 1980s. The moderation 
        in real output volatility, along with the decline in inflation and its 
        stabilization around low levels, probably reduced perceptions of how much 
        economic and financial variables would possibly deviate from expectations 
        and may thus account for part of the explanation for the decline in risk 
        premiums. I know part of this has already been discussed this morning, 
        and will, no doubt, also be featured during the remainder of the conference, 
        given its fundamental nature and potential to explain declines in risk 
        premiums across markets. But I am intrigued by efforts to separate the 
        extent to which the decline in risk premiums in recent decades is due 
        to a reduction in inflation versus a reduction in real output volatility. 
        In that regard, does the fact that most of the decline occurred by the 
        end of the 1980s suggest that inflation control played a more important 
        role than the damping of business cycles, which might reveal itself more 
        gradually over time?

[SECTION]

However, even if we think we understand the trends, the challenges become 
        more pressing when we look at movements in, and relationships among, risk 
        premiums as they happen. Our first challenge is to determine when a movement 
        is not just noise that will quickly reverse, but rather a signal of something 
        important that we need to understand as we formulate policy. For example, 
        does the backup in the equity risk premium over the past year arise from 
        some deep-seated and long-lasting macroeconomic cause that we need to 
        consider for our policy decisions, or is it a mere blip? To separate signal 
        from noise, we try to look not only at the persistence of movements but 
        also at their correlation across markets. Is there a widespread increase 
        or decrease in risk aversion or in perceived risk that suggests a shift 
        in underlying attitudes and expectations? If there is, the monetary authority 
        may well need to adjust the stance of policy as the FOMC did in the fall 
        of 1998.

[SECTION]

Disparate movements in risk premiums, such as those we witnessed in 
        equity and fixed income markets recently and that are highlighted in the 
        bottom panel of the exhibit, are not unusual and can occur for a number 
        of reasons. For one, we are measuring premiums in various markets that 
        have different risk exposures. Securities with different pay-off structures 
        naturally may react differently to a given shock. For example, a relatively 
        modest downward revision to expected spending may raise more questions 
        about returns on equity than on corporate debt. Alternatively, markets 
        may be reacting to different shocks, or to changes to the capital structure 
        of firms; over the last few years, lengthening debt maturities and increases 
        in liquid asset holdings may have supported debt holders at the expense 
        of equity holders. Or, as in the 1950s, perceptions may shift as a consequence 
        of recent events. From time to time, risk premiums also may be affected 
        by changes in demand and supply driven by legal or regulatory requirements, 
        by exogenous changes in issuance patterns, or by shifting asset preferences 
        for reasons unrelated to changing expectations or attitudes toward risk.

[SECTION]

To repeat, divergences in risk premiums are not necessarily unusual 
        if looked at from a historical perspective. And surely different co-movements 
        can reflect different risks--or risk shifts--and different preferences--or 
        preference shifts--which can change the equilibrium relation across markets. 
        But an understanding of what caused the divergent movements could be important 
        for policymakers. For example, changes in perceived risk in some specific 
        markets might point to certain economic weaknesses that policy may need 
        to address. On the other hand, a shift in asset preferences that raised 
        premiums in some markets but lowered them in others could potentially 
        leave overall financial conditions, and their implications for spending, 
        not much changed. Thus, it is important for policymakers to look at risk 
        premiums in their entirety, rather than in isolation, before reaching 
        policy conclusions.

[SECTION]

Today I have mostly characterized policymakers as avid readers of risk 
        perceptions across markets, but our actions could affect risk premiums 
        as well. For instance, an effective monetary policy may well have been 
        one factor in the great moderation of inflation and business cycles that 
        I mentioned earlier. And our efforts in recent years to make the policymaking 
        process more transparent may, almost by definition, have reduced uncertainty 
        and thus compressed risk premiums. We have emphasized the conditional 
        nature of our discussions of future policy to help market participants 
        calibrate their assessments and price risk. To the extent that the decline 
        in risk premiums induced by clearer policy communication has accurately 
        reflected the decrease in uncertainty, assets will be better priced. Finally, 
        some have asserted that our accommodative policy stance in recent years, 
        made necessary by the macroeconomic situation, itself has tended to drive 
        down risk premiums as investors "reached for yield." Notably, however, 
        most risk spreads have remained narrow even as we have been removing policy 
        accommodation.

[SECTION]

My purpose today has not been to interpret or forecast risk premiums 
        or the specific way in which they will affect the future path of monetary 
        policy. Rather, I have taken advantage of a captive audience of researchers 
        on this topic to try to impress on you the importance to the central bank 
        of research along these lines. By outlining how we use estimates of risk 
        premiums and the complications we have encountered, I hope I have given 
        you a sense that we are a ready market for work that improves our understanding 
        of the topic. Any such improvement will help us interpret financial developments 
        as we conduct monetary policy in pursuit of our goals of economic growth 
        and price stability.
