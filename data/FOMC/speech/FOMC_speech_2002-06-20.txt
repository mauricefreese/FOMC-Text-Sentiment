Banking Supervision and Its Application in Developing Countries

[SECTION]

I am very pleased to participate in the Finance Forum 2002.  As a former banker and current bank supervisor, I would like to focus my remarks on the process of building a strong system of financial supervision and regulation.  Generally speaking, I believe a sound supervisory framework must be dynamic and must closely mirror the realities of the financial sector for which it is created.  As such, though best practices in industrial countries are an important starting point for thinking about enhancing supervisory frameworks, one also should bear in mind that a single framework very rarely fits all types of banking organizations or banking systems.
