Thank you, very much, Mr. Secretary.  I needn't tell you that the Federal Reserve is quite pleased to be part of this event.

[SECTION]

As many of you know, the Federal Reserve has the responsibility of putting currency into circulation through the banking system.

[SECTION]

We are most gratified with the successful introduction of the new $100 and $50 notes.  To date,
about two thirds of all $100 bills and about a third of all $50 bills are the new Series 1996 notes.

[SECTION]

Banks obtain the currency they need for their customers from their district Federal Reserve Banks, and they dispose of surplus currency by returning it to their Reserve Banks.

[SECTION]

In this process the Reserve Banks also determine whether each note is in good enough condition to be recirculated and to verify each note for genuineness.

[SECTION]

Approximately two thirds of all notes received by the Reserve Banks in incoming deposits are fit enough to be re-circulated.

[SECTION]

The remaining third -- which are worn out or soiled -- are destroyed and replaced by new notes obtained from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

[SECTION]

The new $20s -- the third note in the series -- will be ready for circulation this fall.

[SECTION]

Because of the number of $20 notes in circulation -- the newer bills will be phased in over a period of time and will replace the older $20 notes as the older notes become soiled or worn out.

[SECTION]

Since the average circulation life of a $20 bill is only about two years, we expect that within a few years a high proportion of the $20s in circulation will be of the new series.

[SECTION]

The Reserve Banks and their branches around the country provide currency to banks and other depositories in their territories as these institutions need it.

[SECTION]

Consequently, not all bank customers will be seeing the new $20 notes immediately.

[SECTION]

I want to assure you that old notes will not be recalled or devalued.  All existing notes will continue to be legal tender.

[SECTION]

The United States has always honored its currency at its full face value, no matter how old.

[SECTION]

Our currency is trusted and accepted by people throughout the world.  Because of this special status, the protection of our currency from counterfeiting has long been a priority.

[SECTION]

... So, rest assured that the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve System remain firmly committed to that goal.

[SECTION]

And now, Mr. Secretary, I believe we are ready to introduce the redesigned currency.
