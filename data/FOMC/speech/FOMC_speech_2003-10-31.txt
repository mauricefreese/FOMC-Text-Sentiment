Effective Market Discipline:  The Roles of Auditors, Companies, and Analysts

[SECTION]



[SECTION]

I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the Bank for International Settlements for the opportunity to speak to you tonight.  This conference addresses the important and timely topic of market discipline.  Last evening Tom Jones spoke about the challenges in achieving high-quality, convergent, international accounting standards.  My remarks, too, will touch on the importance of sound accounting and auditing, but I will also focus on the growing importance of transparent disclosures to the effective functioning of financial markets.  Further, I will discuss how information users, particularly those who provide analysis to investors, can improve the quality and accessibility of their analysis.  I will use some recent research on pension fund accounting to illustrate this issue.  And, at the risk of setting a bleak tone for the remainder of the evening, I will also discuss the difficulties associated with achieving meaningful disclosure.
