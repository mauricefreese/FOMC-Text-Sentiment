The rapid technological innovation that spurred the advancement of the "information economy" has resulted in some dramatic capital gains and losses in equity markets in recent years.  These remarkable developments have attracted considerable attention from economists and from macroeconomic policymakers.  At the same time, movements in the prices of some other assets in the economy--changes in house prices, for example--have been steadier, less dramatic, but perhaps no less significant.

However, in the presence of increased capital gains, unrealized but still perceived as permanent, debt capacity and levels are likely to rise.  The consequently lowered debt repayment relative to debt extensions suggests that the rate of offset to the initial consumption expenditures at the time of repayment is also likely to be a good deal less.  Our preliminary estimates, in fact, suggest that such subtractions from the gross effects on spending are modest.
