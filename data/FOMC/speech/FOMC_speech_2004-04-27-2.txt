        and Banking Relationships

I am very pleased to be here for the Financial Executives 
        International 2004 Summit. As many of you know, before my appointment 
        to the Board of Governors, I was quite active in this organization, particularly 
        on the Committee on Corporate Reporting. I also served on the Financial 
        Accounting Standards Board's Emerging Issues Task Force. Now, as a member 
        of the Federal Reserve Board, and Chair of the Board's Committee on Supervisory 
        and Regulatory Affairs, I find myself focusing on the growth and evolution 
        of the financial system from a slightly different perspective than when 
        I was a chief financial officer.

[SECTION]

The continuing evolution of the banking and financial markets has created 
        opportunities both for providers and for users of financial products, 
        and this evolution has been beneficial to the economy. However, innovations 
        in financial products also have given rise to some new challenges for 
        market participants and their supervisors in the areas of corporate governance 
        and compliance. The events of the past three years demonstrate again that 
        fraudulent conduct and weak corporate governance at a few firms can dramatically 
        change the cost of capital and impose additional regulatory burden on 
        even well-managed organizations.

[SECTION]

When similar events occurred in the 1980s, FEI, one of the five members 
        of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission, 
        took the lead in defining best practices for internal controls. FEI should 
        be proud that the COSO Internal Control Framework was the basis of much 
        of the internal control mandates of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and still is 
        seen as the seminal work in its field. Fundamental elements of corporate 
        governance and compliance naturally become more challenging as activities 
        become more complex. The major breaks in the internal controls of corporations 
        in the past few years, and the role of bankers in those events, has led 
        bank regulators to change their view of bankers' relationships with their 
        corporate clients. Today, I'd like to touch on some of these challenges 
        and on how financial institutions and their corporate customers can adopt 
        new ways of working together. I am going to talk about some new regulatory 
        guidance on complex structured finance transactions and guidance on industry 
        best practice regarding credit risk transfer instruments. I also want 
        to speak about an issue that is confusing to many companies: anti-tying 
        regulation as it relates to services provided by banking organizations.

[SECTION]

But before I talk about these issues, I would like to step back and discuss 
        some broader, longer-term issues that affect accounting and corporate 
        governance. Looking beyond the isolated cases of outright fraud, I believe 
        a fundamental problem is this: As organizations have grown in size and 
        scope, innovative financing techniques have made it more difficult for 
        outside investors to understand a particular firm's risk profile and the 
        performance of its various lines of business. Traditional accounting standards 
        have not kept pace with the risk-management tools employed by sophisticated 
        corporations. Thus, more meaningful disclosure of firms' risk-management 
        positions and strategies is crucial for improving corporate transparency 
        for market participants.

[SECTION]

Financial Innovations and Disclosure
        Over the past few decades, firms have acquired effective new tools with 
        which to manage financial risk. For example, securitization helps a firm 
        manage the risk of a concentrated exposure by transferring some of that 
        exposure outside the firm. By pooling assets and issuing marketable securities, 
        firms obtain liquidity and reduce funding costs. Of course, moving assets 
        off the balance sheet and into special purpose entities, with the attendant 
        creation of servicing rights and high risk residual interests retained 
        by firms, generates its own risks and reduces transparency unless the 
        firm takes additional steps to enhance disclosure.

[SECTION]

Several types of securitization have grown rapidly over the past decade. 
        One of the fastest growing has been asset-backed commercial paper, which 
        soared from only $16 billion outstanding at the end of 1989 to about $690 
        billion as of year-end 2003. Commercial mortgage securitizations have 
        also proliferated noticeably since the early 1990s. The dollar amount 
        of outstanding securities backed by commercial and multifamily mortgages 
        has risen from $36 billion at the end of 1989 to just under $450 billion 
        as of this past September. In addition, commercial banks and finance companies 
        have moved business loans off their books through the development of collateralized 
        debt obligations. Securitized business loans amounted to $100 billion 
        in the third quarter of 2003, up from a relatively miniscule $2 billion 
        in 1989.

[SECTION]

Firms also use derivatives to manage their risk exposures to price fluctuations 
        in currency, commodity, energy, and interest rate markets. More recently, 
        firms have used credit derivatives, a relatively new type of derivative 
        that allows them to purchase protection against the risk of loss from 
        the default of a given entity. By purchasing such protection, financial 
        and nonfinancial firms alike can reduce their exposures to particular 
        borrowers or counterparties. Credit derivatives also allow financial firms 
        to achieve a more diversified credit portfolio by acquiring credit exposure 
        to borrowers with which they do not have a lending relationship. For example, 
        European insurance companies reportedly have used credit derivatives to 
        acquire exposure to European corporations that, because they rely primarily 
        on bank lending, have little publicly traded debt outstanding.

[SECTION]

The improvements in technology, the quick pace of financial innovation, 
        and the evolving risk-management techniques almost ensure that businesses 
        will increasingly use almost limitless configurations of products and 
        services and sophisticated financial structures. Accordingly, outsiders 
        will have ever more difficulty understanding the risk positions of many 
        large, complex organizations. These developments represent significant 
        challenges to standard setters and to firms. For market discipline to 
        be effective, accounting standards must evolve to accurately capture these 
        developments.

[SECTION]

Company managers must also do their part, by ensuring that public disclosures 
        clearly identify all significant risk exposures--whether on or off the 
        balance sheet--and their effects on the firm's financial condition and 
        performance, cash flow, and earnings potential. With regard to securitizations, 
        derivatives, and other innovative risk-transfer instruments, accounting 
        measurement of a company's balance sheet at a point in time is insufficient 
        to convey the full effect of a company's financial risk profile.

[SECTION]

Organizations should continue to improve their enterprise-wide risk-management 
        and reporting functions. The FEI's leadership in the proposed COSO Enterprise 
        Risk Management Framework demonstrates this organization's recognition 
        of the importance of this new discipline. I would like to challenge companies 
        to use their new risk-management discipline as a framework also to begin 
        disclosing this information to the market, perhaps in summary form, paying 
        due attention to the need for keeping proprietary business data confidential. 
        Disclosures would not only provide more qualitative and quantitative information 
        about the firm's current risk exposure to the market but also help the 
        market assess the quality of the risk oversight and risk appetite of the 
        organization.

[SECTION]

My last comment on disclosures is that less than fully transparent disclosures 
        are not limited to "complex" off-balance-sheet transactions. One glaring 
        example is the treatment of expenses associated with defined-benefit pension 
        plans. In recent years we have seen how the accounting rules for these 
        plans can produce, quite frankly, some very misleading measures of corporate 
        earnings and balance sheets. In effect, firms use expectations of the 
        long-term return on assets in defined-benefit plans to calculate current-period 
        pension costs (income). At the same time, they use a spot rate to discount 
        the future liabilities. This accounting is reconciled with economic reality 
        by gradual amortization of the discrepancies between the assumed and the 
        actual returns experienced on pension assets. As many of you are aware, 
        this smoothing feature can create very large distortions between economic 
        reality and the pension-financing cost accruals embedded in the income 
        statement.

[SECTION]

A recent study by Federal Reserve staff indicates that "full disclosure" 
        of the underlying details, by itself, does not appear to be a panacea.1 
        The study adopts the premise that most of what investors need to know 
        about the true pension-financing costs, not the mixed-attribute accounting 
        costs, can be reflected in two numbers disclosed in the pension footnote. 
        These two numbers are the fair market value of pension assets and the 
        present value of outstanding pension liabilities. The study finds that 
        these direct measures of pension assets and liabilities tend to be ignored 
        by investors in favor of the potentially misleading accounting measures, 
        and as a result, the average firm with a defined-benefit plan in 2001 
        may have been 5 percent to 10 percent overvalued relative to an otherwise 
        similar firm without a defined-benefit plan.

[SECTION]

In general, the test for useful disclosure should be the following questions: 
        Are the firm and its accountants providing investors with what is needed 
        to accurately evaluate the financial position of the firm and the risks 
        that it faces? And is the information provided in a manner that facilitates 
        accurate assessments by investors? Ultimately, improved transparency would 
        benefit corporations by reducing uncertainty about the value of their 
        securities, which would lower the cost of, and increase access to, market 
        funding.

[SECTION]

Complex Structured Finance Transactions 
        Financial innovation also has given rise to an increase in the sophistication 
        of complex structured finance transactions. While we can hope that we 
        are seeing the end of the corporate governance scandals that have plagued 
        companies world-wide, we must remain alert to the underlying causes of 
        these scandals--inadequate corporate governance structures, compliance 
        frameworks, and internal controls--and redouble our efforts to create 
        a new compliance environment. This new compliance environment must address 
        the growth in complex structured finance transactions.

[SECTION]

What do we mean by complex structured finance transactions? Although 
        each deal can vary, complex structured finance transactions generally 
        have four common characteristics. First, they typically result in a final 
        product that is often nonstandard and structured to meet the specific 
        financial objectives of a customer. Second, they often involve professionals 
        from multiple disciplines within the financial institution and may involve 
        significant fees or high returns in relation to the market and credit 
        risks associated with the transaction. Third, they may be associated with 
        the creation or use of one or more special-purpose entities designed to 
        address the economic, legal, tax, or accounting objectives of the customer 
        or the use of a combination of cash and derivatives products. Fourth, 
        and perhaps most important, they may expose the financial institution 
        to elevated levels of market, credit, operations, legal, or reputational 
        risks.

[SECTION]

As we are all too aware, in the most extreme cases, complex structured 
        finance transactions appear to have been used in fraudulent schemes to 
        misrepresent the financial condition of public companies or evade taxes. 
        As a result, the corporations that engaged in these improper transactions 
        and the financial institutions that structured and advised on these transactions 
        have been subject to civil and administrative enforcement actions. The 
        existence of these schemes has also sparked an investigation by the Permanent 
        Subcommittee on Investigations of the Senate Committee on Governmental 
        Affairs, as well as numerous lawsuits by private investors.

[SECTION]

Although these events have raised serious concerns, it is important to 
        recognize that structured finance transactions and other market innovations, 
        when used and designed appropriately, play an important role in financing 
        corporate America. Structured finance transactions, as well as financial 
        derivatives for market and credit risk, asset-backed securities with customized 
        cash flow features, and specialized financial conduits that manage pools 
        of purchased assets, have served the legitimate business purposes of bank 
        customers and are an essential part of U.S. and international capital 
        markets.

[SECTION]

However, financial institutions may assume substantial risks when they 
        engage in these transactions without a full understanding of their economic 
        substance and business purpose. These risks often are difficult to quantify 
        but the result can be severe damage to the reputations of the companies 
        engaging in the transactions and their financial advisers, and in turn, 
        impaired public confidence in those institutions. These potential risks 
        and the resulting damage are particularly severe when markets react through 
        adverse changes in pricing for similarly structured transactions that 
        are designed appropriately.

[SECTION]

Assessments of the appropriateness of a transaction for a client traditionally 
        have required financial firms and advisers to determine if the transaction 
        is consistent with the market sophistication, financial condition, and 
        investment policies of the customer. Given recent events, it is appropriate 
        to raise the bar on appropriateness assessments by taking into account 
        the business purpose and economic substance of the transaction. For those 
        of you who are CFOs or other senior officials of corporations seeking 
        to engage in complex structured finance transactions, you should expect 
        to receive more questions from your bankers on why you wish to engage 
        in certain transactions, how you will account for them for financial reporting 
        and tax purposes, and how you will explain them to your shareholders and 
        other stakeholders. You can expect this heightened level of inquiry because, 
        when banking organizations provide advice on, arrange, or actively participate 
        in complex structured finance transactions, they may assume legal and 
        reputational risks if the end-user enters into the transaction for improper 
        purposes.

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve has been working with the other federal banking agencies 
        and the Securities and Exchange Commission to develop interagency guidance 
        on complex structured finance transactions. We believe it is important 
        for all participants in complex structured transactions to understand 
        the agencies' concerns and supervisory direction. Our goal is to highlight 
        the "lessons learned" from recent events as well as what we believe to 
        be sound practices in this area on the basis of supervisory reviews and 
        experience.

[SECTION]

As in other operational areas, strong internal controls and risk management 
        procedures can help institutions effectively manage the risks associated 
        with complex structured finance transactions. Here are some of the steps 
        that financial institutions should take to establish such controls and 
        procedures: 
      
 Ensure that the institution's board of directors establishes the 
          institution's overall appetite for risk (especially reputational and 
          legal) and effectively communicates the board's risk tolerances throughout 
          the organization. 
Implement firm-wide policies and procedures that provide for the consistent 
          identification, evaluation, documentation, and management of all risks 
          associated with complex structured transactions--in particular, the 
          credit, reputational, and legal risks. 
 Implement firm-wide policies and procedures that ensure that the 
          financial institution obtains a thorough understanding of the business 
          purposes and economic substance of transactions identified as involving 
          heightened legal or reputational risk and that these transactions are 
          approved by appropriate senior management. 
 Clearly define the framework for approval of a complex structured 
          finance transaction or a new complex structured finance product. 
 Implement monitoring, risk reporting, and compliance processes for 
          creating, analyzing, offering, and marketing complex structured finance 
          products.

[SECTION]

Of course, these internal controls need to be supported and enforced 
        by a strong "tone at the top" and a firm-wide culture of compliance.

[SECTION]

As a result of recent public and supervisory attention to complex structured 
        finance transactions, we expect that banks will be asking more questions, 
        requesting additional documentation, and scrutinizing financial statements 
        more carefully to guard against reputational and legal risk. For example, 
        for transactions identified as involving heightened risks, we expect that 
        the bank's staff would obtain and document, before approval of the transaction, 
        complete and accurate information about the customer's proposed accounting 
        treatment of the transaction, financial disclosures relating to the transaction, 
        and the customer's objectives for entering into the transaction. This 
        enhanced due diligence may appear to impose some documentation burdens 
        on the corporate customers of banking organizations, but this information 
        should be substantially similar to the information that corporate customers 
        are providing to their own senior management and boards of directors as 
        part of their own internal review and approval process for complex structured 
        finance transactions.

[SECTION]

Our supervisory reviews indicate that many financial institutions have 
        already taken steps to enhance their internal controls and due-diligence 
        processes in order to filter out transactions with unacceptable levels 
        of reputational and legal risk. As a result, some financial institutions 
        have turned down deals with unfavorable risk characteristics that they 
        may have accepted in the past. While we applaud these developments, we 
        hope that the guidance we are developing will help further improve the 
        awareness, among both banking organizations and their corporate customers, 
        of sound practices in this area.

[SECTION]

Credit Risk Transfer and Conflicts of Interest 
        Financial market innovation and the development of increasingly complex 
        structures for credit risk transfer also may give rise to legal or reputational 
        risk. In recent years, we have seen considerable advances in the management 
        and transfer of credit risk, including credit default swaps and collateralized 
        debt obligations. These practices and the development of new and more 
        liquid markets have come about because of better risk measurement techniques. 
        They have the potential, I believe, to substantially improve the efficiency 
        of world financial markets through the diversification benefits that credit 
        risk transfer mechanisms can provide. However, the fundamental elements 
        of risk management must be kept firmly in mind if these innovations are 
        to succeed.

[SECTION]

By their design, credit risk transfer instruments segment risk for distribution 
        to the parties most willing to accept them. A key point, however, is that 
        market participants must be able to recognize and understand the risks 
        underlying the instruments they trade and be able to successfully absorb 
        and diffuse any subsequent loss. Another consideration is whether one 
        party to the transaction is entering into the trade with an unfair advantage 
        by virtue of its role as a lender to the same or a related entity.

[SECTION]

Financial firms that have large corporate loan portfolios increasingly 
        have accessed the credit derivatives market to help them manage their 
        risk while continuing to extend credit to corporate customers. While this 
        development has created market efficiencies and investment opportunities, 
        these positive factors have been somewhat overshadowed by concerns that 
        some credit market participants who receive material nonpublic information 
        in the ordinary course of their normal business activities may need to 
        better control access to that information. Specifically, access to material 
        nonpublic information needs to be walled off from personnel who conduct 
        securities and derivatives trading.

[SECTION]

The potential for conflicts of interest between loan origination and 
        credit derivatives trading activities has been recognized by the industry 
        as well as regulators, and that is a commendable development. In October 
        2003, the Joint Market Practices Forum, a collaborative effort of the 
        Bond Market Association, the International Association of Credit Portfolio 
        Managers, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, and the 
        Loan Syndications and Trading Association, issued a Statement of Principles 
        and Recommendations Regarding the Handling of Material Nonpublic Information 
        by Credit Market Participants. The statement articulates principles 
        and recommendations regarding the handling and use of material nonpublic 
        information by credit market participants that maintain loan portfolios 
        or engage in other activities that generate credit exposures and, in that 
        connection, enter into transactions in securities or security-based swaps, 
        including certain credit derivatives.

[SECTION]

The statement of principles fulfills a number of objectives. The most 
        critical, in my view, is the promotion of fair and competitive markets 
        in which the inappropriate use of material nonpublic information is not 
        tolerated. At the same time, the statement allows lenders to effectively 
        manage credit portfolio activities to facilitate borrower access to more-liquid 
        and more-efficient sources of credit. This effort recognizes that the 
        liquidity and efficiency of our financial markets are related directly 
        to the integrity of, and public confidence in, those markets.

[SECTION]

The joint statement describes two models of credit portfolio management: 
        the "private side" model and the "public side" model. In reality, most 
        banking organizations appear to have adopted a hybrid model that lies 
        at some point along a continuum between pure private and pure public.

[SECTION]

In general, in a private-side model, credit derivatives traders may have 
        access to material nonpublic information, but traders must pre-clear each 
        transaction they execute. In a public-side model, traders are walled off 
        from private-side information and personnel to prevent their access to 
        material nonpublic information. Accordingly, the circumstances in which 
        a transaction is restricted because of the trader's possession of material 
        nonpublic information is limited.

[SECTION]

The forum's statement of principles also provides several meaningful 
        recommendations, some of which already have been adopted by the major 
        participants in the credit derivatives markets. Among other things, the 
        recommendations call for market participants to have in place policies 
        and procedures for handling material nonpublic information, internal controls, 
        an independent compliance function, recordkeeping requirements, and training 
        programs. Additional specific recommendations are advanced for credit 
        portfolio management activities conducted from the private side and from 
        the public side.

[SECTION]

At a recent Bond Market Association conference, attendees noted that 
        the principles contained in the statement generally are workable. However, 
        questions of interpretation do arise under the statement and can be expected 
        to continue to arise as the market develops additional innovations in 
        credit portfolio management.

[SECTION]

Questions of interpretation may arise in determining whether and to what 
        extent information is public or private, especially for organizations 
        operating in global markets. Does material nonpublic information on one 
        name in an index fund taint the entire index? Are the bank's internal 
        ratings or changes in internal ratings private information? Issues of 
        "signaling" private information also arise when public-side traders become 
        aware of transactions entered into on the private side. That is, to what 
        extent can traders infer material nonpublic information through action 
        (or inaction) in private-side business lines?

[SECTION]

Last, but certainly not least, information may be confidential or proprietary 
        even if it does not rise to the level of material nonpublic information. 
        The misuse of confidential or proprietary information that is not material 
        nonpublic information may not give rise to securities law violations, 
        but it may give rise to common law claims.

[SECTION]

The statement and recommendations of the Joint Market Practices Forum 
        brings to light important potential conflicts of interest in credit derivatives 
        trading and helps to identify issues that may arise in connection with 
        credit portfolio management. The statement and recommendations provide 
        guidance on credit portfolio management for financial institutions that 
        may be new to the derivatives markets and provide a catalyst to further 
        improvements in the risk management environment. Credit risk transfer 
        is still a relatively young market, and attention to issues such as these 
        should help participants develop confidence in both the new instruments 
        and markets that will lead to more liquid and reliable transactions.

[SECTION]

Anti-Tying Restrictions on Banks 
        Finally, I want to discuss the nature of anti-tying regulations for financial 
        institutions, an issue that can be very confusing to nonbankers. As innovations 
        create new financial instruments, services, and markets, and as firms 
        expand the scope of the types of financial services they offer, the business-decision 
        process is similar to that which many of you apply in your own business. 
        Financial institutions are trying to build customer loyalty by offering 
        a broader menu of financial services to corporate customers. The concern 
        addressed by anti-tying restrictions is that banks may force customers 
        to take unwanted products to obtain needed services.

[SECTION]

The Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have 
        long required that banking organizations establish and maintain policies 
        and procedures to ensure compliance with the anti-tying restrictions, 
        and the agencies monitor these policies and procedures through the supervisory 
        process. In addition, more-targeted examinations may be conducted to review 
        marketing programs, training materials, internal risk management reports, 
        internal audits, and any internal investigations.

[SECTION]

In 2002 and 2003, the federal banking agencies received a number of inquiries 
        concerning the scope, effectiveness, and impact of the anti-tying restrictions 
        on banks. Some of these inquiries suggested that commercial banks were 
        unfairly competing for investment banking business by tying the provision 
        of bank credit to investment banking business. In this connection, a March 
        2003 survey by the Association of Financial Professionals indicated that 
        24 percent of the 218 large corporate respondents to the survey had been 
        told explicitly by a commercial bank that the company had been denied 
        credit or had been extended credit on less favorable terms because the 
        company did not award the bank underwriting business. In response, the 
        commercial banks stated that they were not involved in impermissible tying 
        but rather engaged in the pursuit of relationship banking that is completely 
        legal, efficient from an economic perspective and, indeed, encouraged 
        by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act as a means to provide customers with "one-stop 
        financial shopping."

[SECTION]

Some of the confusion surrounding the tying debate may stem from a misunderstanding 
        of the law. Not all tying arrangements are illegal ties. The statute expressly 
        permits certain forms of tying and authorizes the Board to grant additional 
        exemptions by regulation or order. The anti-tying law and the Board's 
        regulations expressly permit a bank to condition the availability or price 
        of a product or service on a requirement that the customer also obtain 
        a traditional bank product from the bank or an affiliate of the 
        bank. A traditional bank product generally is a loan, discount, deposit, 
        or trust service. On the other hand, conditioning the availability or 
        price of a loan on a requirement that the customer engage the bank for 
        an underwriting, or obtain some other product or service that is not a 
        traditional bank product, clearly is prohibited.

[SECTION]

Incidentally, the anti-tying statute applied to banks is tougher than 
        the general corporate antitrust laws. Unlike the general anti-tying laws, 
        the statute applicable to banks does not require a showing of market power 
        to support a violation. It can be difficult to determine whether a violation 
        of the anti-tying statute has occurred, as it generally involves a careful 
        analysis of specific facts and circumstances that are not memorialized 
        and can involve divining the intent of the parties to a transaction.

[SECTION]

In light of these complexities, the Board published and sought public 
        comment on an interpretation of the anti-tying statute and related supervisory 
        guidance. The proposed interpretation was published to help banking organizations 
        and corporate customers clarify permissible practices under this complex 
        statute in today's financial services environment. Importantly, the interpretation 
        proposes guidelines that could be followed when a bank seeks to engage 
        in traditional "relationship banking," that is, serving customers based 
        on the profitability of the overall customer relationship, including the 
        establishment of some regulatory "safe harbors." The guidance would communicate 
        our expectations as to the types of policies, procedures, internal controls, 
        and training programs that should help banks comply with the anti-tying 
        restrictions. It would also emphasize the importance of the compliance 
        and internal audit functions in ensuring compliance with the law and regulations.

[SECTION]

Among the comments received on the anti-tying guidance was a November 
        7, 2003, letter from the Department of Justice and published on its own 
        website. The Justice Department has recommended that the Board interpret 
        the anti-tying statute in a manner consistent with, and no broader than, 
        the interpretation of federal antitrust laws. If this limitation is precluded, 
        the Justice Department urged the Board to exercise its statutory authority 
        to expand the scope of exemptions so as to limit the scope of the statute 
        to ties involving small businesses and individual consumers. The letter 
        expressed concern that the anti-tying statute may prohibit some pro-competitive 
        practices, in particular, multiproduct discounting.

The Board's staff continues to review and analyze the comments that have 
        been received, and we expect to issue final guidance later in the year.

Conclusion 
        FEI's focus on providing corporate financial officers with information 
        to keep them aware of evolutions in best business practices and process 
        has contributed to the financial strength of businesses today. The organization 
        also provides an effective source of dialogue on emerging issues in finance 
        and governance. I encourage you, as senior officers of your firms, to 
        keep this discussion alive within your firms. When businesses have a strong 
        focus on corporate ethics, a robust internal control culture, and transparent 
        disclosure, financial markets can provide capital efficiently.
