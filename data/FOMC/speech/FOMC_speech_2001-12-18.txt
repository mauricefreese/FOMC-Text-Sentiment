While promising, these initiatives have not been without difficulties. Implementation and compliance in the emerging-markets countries is uneven, and much remains to be done.  Market participants are beginning to pay more attention to compliance with standards and codes, but scope for significant progress in this area remains.  For example, compliance does not appear to be important in setting credit ratings or lending terms.  More fundamentally, some emerging-market countries have complained of a lack of sensitivity to their particular circumstance, and have called for a more realistic view of the feasible pace of reform and clearer priorities.  For emerging-market economies, it makes sense for standards and codes to focus on minimum standards because the appropriate standards will vary across countries depending on the resources and experience of officials, the structures of financial systems, and the cultural values and norms.  Because a country may have unique circumstances, not all international standards are appropriate for each emerging-market economy.  In the Basel II process, for example, standards appropriate for large, internationally active banks in the developed industrial economies may be inappropriate for emerging-market economies.

Reform of International Financial Institutions
Another focus of reform efforts in recent years has been the international financial institutions.  Changes have been made, and more are planned.  The IMF's lending facilities have been modified, including the introduction of an "expectation of early repurchase," which will tend to reduce the maturity of IMF lending, and an escalation of loan charges once a country's outstanding obligations to the IMF exceed certain thresholds.  These measures are intended to encourage countries' return to capital markets as quickly as possible and to discourage excessive dependence on IMF financing.

The IMF also has recently moved to make the pricing of its Contingent Credit Lines, or CCL, more attractive to potential borrowers.  The CCL was established in 1999 to provide liquidity to prequalified countries with track records of sound policies.  However, this facility has never been used.  Countries have expressed concerns that the benefits of being prequalified are more than offset by the potential costs of being disqualified if their policies subsequently are deemed to have weakened.  Countries have also voiced concerns that simply applying for the CCL may be interpreted by the markets as a signal of vulnerability.

As mentioned previously, the IMF has also moved to improve its ability to assess the economic and financial vulnerabilities of its members, including efforts to identify national balance sheet and liquidity risks, as part of a broader initiative to strengthen the IMF's surveillance efforts.  Measures to discourage misreporting have been strengthened, and efforts have been made to make the IMF's operations more transparent, including the publication of policy documents.

The role of conditionality in IMF programs has been a subject of ongoing debate.  Critics have argued that these programs, particularly those constructed during the Asian crises, have carried too many detailed conditions and have focused disproportionately on structural objectives rather than on the macroeconomic issues that are the IMF's core mandate.  It has been argued that this represents micromanagement and reduces the scope for country ownership of adjustment programs.  In response to this critique, the IMF has said that it is moving to streamline and focus conditionality, particularly with respect to structural measures, and to provide greater clarity as to why conditions in certain areas are included in or excluded from programs. Though efforts to provide greater focus to conditionality are welcome, they should not come at the expense of the underlying rigor of Fund programs or the protection of its resources that conditionality provides.

There have also been initiatives to reform the multilateral development banks.  It has been suggested that there should be increasing selectivity in projects, a reform in pricing policies involving more differentiation across lending activities and borrowers, and improved methods of monitoring the compliance of borrowers.  In addition, there have been calls for the IMF and the World Bank to show greater sensitivity to the needs of the world's poorest countries.  The process of translating these general principles into concrete policies has somewhat progressed, but it appears still to be in its early stages.

Private-Sector Involvement
An important and evolving aspect of dealing with emerging-market financial crises is what has come to be referred to as private-sector involvement.  The central issue here is the role of private-sector creditors during default or restructuring of an emerging-market economy's debt.  Unlike the bankruptcy of a firm in a domestic market, for which procedures are generally codified and settled, the default of a sovereign nation currently involves no binding legal jurisdiction or enforcement mechanism.  The goal of private-sector involvement is to ensure that, in a crisis, private-sector creditors, particularly bondholders with instruments denominated in or linked to a foreign currency, participate in efforts to resolve the problem.  Such participation can take various forms--debt exchanges, rollovers, restructurings, provision of new money, or outright losses.

The extent to which the private sector has helped resolve emerging-market crises has evolved over time.  During the debt crises of the 1980s, official support generally was focused on financing current account shortfalls and easing the macroeconomic adjustment process.  Bank creditors restructured old loans, extended new loans, and eventually--under the Brady plan--exchanged their loans for bonds with diminished value.  During the 1990s, however, bonds became much more important as sources of credit for many countries.  This greater importance raised new issues for debt restructuring, given the more atomistic and dispersed nature of bondholders as a group.  The emergence of very large international support packages--for Mexico in 1995, several Asian countries and Brazil in 1997 and 1998, and Turkey and Argentina more recently--may be seen in part as a response to the perceived difficulties of engaging private creditors, particularly bondholders, in the resolution of emerging-market debt problems.  This point, however, should not be overstated.  Many private investors--most notably those who invested in equities--have taken substantial losses during recent crises.

[SECTION]

The provision of large financial-assistance packages has been criticized because of a focus on only two possible outcomes for emerging-market economies facing financial difficulties--either default or no default, with the international official community viewed as often endeavoring to avoid default at all costs.  Developing procedures aimed at facilitating intermediate solutions--namely, some form of debt restructuring with private-sector involvement--might, in this view, help avoid disruptive, corner solution outcomes.  Moreover, large support programs have been criticized for exacerbating so-called moral hazard by encouraging overborrowing and overlending through leading investors to believe that the official community will bail them out should debt repayment problems arise.

[SECTION]

A key argument for private-sector involvement is that markets will price risk properly and allocate resources efficiently only if investors are forced to bear the costs of their bad decisions.  The hope is that, if the broad principles for achieving private-sector involvement are known in advance, they might reduce investors' uncertainty about the rules of the game and help to ensure that workouts proceed smoothly and predictably.  The principles could facilitate orderly resolution of financial crises and might also help prevent crises by reducing uncertainty as to how investors would be dealt with during times of crisis.

[SECTION]

In recent years, a tremendous amount of discussion has been devoted to considering means by which private investors could be involved during financial crises on an orderly, systematic, and predictable basis.  Yet these efforts still have a long way to go.  Some members of the official community find it difficult to accept the notion of sanctioning arrears or default.  Also, some have concerns that strict limitations on official IMF support could constrain the official sector when such support was genuinely needed to avert international contagion.

[SECTION]

Agreement on abstract principles of private-sector involvement remain elusive, but on the practical level, instances of private-sector involvement are accumulating, laying down a foundation of practices and precedents that should serve to make future restructurings more orderly and predictable.  In recent years, international bond restructurings have been conducted by Pakistan, Ukraine, and Ecuador as a means of either dealing with an existing default or avoiding an impending default.  In addition, the IMF-led financial assistance to both Turkey and Argentina has included various forms of private-sector involvement.  The authorities in Argentina are currently exchanging government debt on terms that involve significant concessions from the private sector.

IMF First Deputy Managing Director Anne Krueger has recently weighed in on the issue of international bankruptcy arrangements.  She proposed that, in the event of an imminent financial crisis by an IMF borrower, there should be, among other policies, an IMF-sanctioned temporary standstill on debt-service payments and negotiated restructurings under IMF auspices of debts to private-sector creditors.  Though better international bankruptcy arrangements have certainly been a longstanding need--as noted by Chairman Greenspan as far back as 1995, immediately after the Mexican crisis--an initial reading of Krueger's proposal suggests that it would face very significant practical problems.  The major problem with the Krueger proposal, as with any scheme to establish international bankruptcy arrangements, stems from the fundamental fact of the political sovereignty of nations.  Debtor and creditor countries alike would have to cede significant sovereignty to the IMF under Krueger's proposal and would almost certainly prove reluctant to do so.  Krueger's proposal merits further study, but some of the more evolutionary, piecemeal changes in international debt-restructuring arrangements, which I discussed under the general rubric of private-sector involvement, probably represent a more realistic hope for near-term improvement in international bankruptcy arrangements.

What Is Left To Be Done?
I have outlined some of the main efforts to prevent or mitigate financial crises in emerging-market economies.  Now the question arises--What are the main tasks that remain to be accomplished?  Many of the initiatives that I have discussed, such as formulation of standards and codes, reform of the international financial institutions, and development of procedures for private-sector involvement in debt restructurings, are processes that are already well under way and that have a momentum of their own.  These areas do not so much need new initiatives as they do the extending, improving, and implementing of existing initiatives.
