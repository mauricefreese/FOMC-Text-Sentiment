1. Attended portion of meeting relating to a report on a study 
        entitled "Operating Procedures and the Conduct of Monetary Policy: 
        Conference Proceedings," edited by Marvin Goodfriend and David 
        Small. This two-volume study has been designated Working Studies 1,

        Discussion Series.

By unanimous vote, the minutes for the meeting of the Federal 
    Open Market Committee held on March 23, 1993, were approved.

[SECTION]

The Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments in foreign exchange markets and on System transactions in 
    foreign currencies during the period March 23, 1993, through May 17, 
    1993. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on 
    developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market 
    transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations 
    during the period March 23, 1993, through May 17, 1993. By unanimous 
    vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic 
    outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
    information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the 
    pace of the economic expansion had slowed in recent months. Business 
    outlays for durable equipment had remained strong, but consumer 
    spending had been quite sluggish, reflecting limited gains in 
    employment and real labor income and diminished optimism about near-term economic prospects. Additionally, U.S. exports continued to be 
    constrained by the disappointing performance of the major foreign 
    industrial economies. Available data indicated relatively modest 
    growth in payroll employment and industrial production over recent 
    months. Despite the considerable slack in the economy, increases in 
    wages and prices had been appreciably larger thus far in 1993 than in 
    the second half of last year.

[SECTION]

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose only slightly on 
    balance over March and April after registering sizable increases in 
    the first two months of the year. Strong job gains in the services 
    industry, notably in business and health services, were offset in 
    considerable measure by job losses in manufacturing and construction 
    in March and April. In manufacturing, reductions in payrolls were 
    widespread, with particularly large declines at manufacturers of 
    transportation equipment. Construction employment recovered only 
    partially in April from the weather-related decline in March. The 
    civilian unemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent.

[SECTION]

Industrial production, after having posted solid gains in 
    previous months, was little changed in March and April. Part of the 
    recent sluggishness reflected a decline in utility output following a 
    weather-related runup in February, but manufacturing output also grew 
    more slowly. In the transportation industry, motor vehicle assemblies 
    edged down and production of civilian aircraft remained weak over 
    March and April. Elsewhere, the output of consumer goods other than 
    motor vehicles was about unchanged, and the continuing strength in the 
    computer industry contrasted with sluggish production of other types 
    of business equipment. Total utilization of industrial capacity 
    changed little over the two months.

[SECTION]

Retail sales increased substantially in April, reversing the 
    weather-related decline in March; automotive dealers reported large 
    sales gains in April, and expenditures at other retail outlets 
    retraced part of the March decrease. For the year to date, however, 
    retail sales had been lackluster after the strong increases of the 
    latter part of 1992. Housing starts picked up in April; both single-family and multifamily starts rebounded from weather-depressed March 
    levels.

[SECTION]

Business fixed investment advanced further during the first 
    quarter of 1993, with another sizable rise in outlays for equipment 
    outweighing continued weakness in nonresidential construction. 
    Shipments of nondefense capital goods during the first quarter were 
    paced by another sharp increase in shipments of office and computing 
    equipment. By contrast, business spending for transportation 
    equipment generally exhibited little strength; although sales of heavy 
    trucks continued to trend up, outlays for complete aircraft apparently 
    edged down further. Recent data on orders for nondefense capital 
    goods other than aircraft suggested further expansion in business 
    spending for equipment in the near term. Nonresidential construction 
    activity was mixed in the first quarter. Office construction declined 
    considerably further in response to the depressing effects of a 
    continuing overhang of unoccupied space. On the other hand, building 
    activity in the public utilities sector continued to trend up, and the 
    construction of commercial structures other than office buildings 
    increased for a second consecutive quarter.

[SECTION]

Business inventories appeared to have risen in the first 
    quarter. Manufacturing inventories expanded in both February and 
    March after a series of declines that began early in the fall; much of 
    the recent advance occurred in the durable goods sector, where shipments were strong, and the ratio of inventories to shipments fell for 
    manufacturing as a whole. Wholesale inventories increased appreciably 
    in March. However, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector moved 
    up only slightly, and it remained near the low end of its range over 
    the past two years. In the retail sector, available data indicated 
    that inventories rose appreciably over January and February but that 
    the inventory-to-sales ratio remained in the narrow range that had 
    prevailed over the preceding year.

[SECTION]

The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in February was 
    unchanged from its January level, reflecting little change in total 
    exports and total imports. For January-February combined, however, 
    the trade deficit was slightly below its average level for the fourth 
    quarter, with both exports and imports down considerably from their 
    fourth-quarter levels. Much of the drop in exports reflected a 
    reversal of an earlier, largely transitory runup in aircraft and 
    automotive products. The decline in imports was spread across all 
    major trade categories; imports of aircraft and miscellaneous 
    industrial supplies dropped appreciably, and imports of consumer goods 
    fell further. Recent indicators pointed to further weakness in 
    economic activity in continental Europe and Japan through the first 
    quarter. Elsewhere, the recovery in the United Kingdom appeared to be 
    firming, and growth continued at a modest pace in Canada.

[SECTION]

Producer prices of finished goods rose more rapidly in March 
    and April, partly as a result of sharp increases in the prices of 
    finished energy goods in March and in the prices of finished foods in 
    April. Excluding the food and energy components, producer prices 
    advanced over the first four months of 1993 at a faster pace than in 
    1992. At the consumer level, the increase in prices of nonfood, non-energy items over the March-April period was smaller than the outsized change over the first two months of the year; nevertheless, 
    averaging over the first four months of the year, the rate of increase 
    in consumer prices was higher than in 1992. The deceleration of labor 
    costs also appeared to have stalled in 1993. Average hourly earnings 
    of production or nonsupervisory workers had grown more rapidly thus 
    far this year than in 1992, and total hourly compensation of private 
    industry workers rose at a faster pace in the first quarter of 1993 
    than in any quarter of last year.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on March 23, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the 
    likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting 
    period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of 
    the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater 
    reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be 
    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions 
    associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with a 
    resumption of moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the second quarter.

[SECTION]

Open market operations during the intermeeting period were 
    directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions. Expected levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing were 
    raised during the period in anticipation of some increase in seasonal 
    borrowing. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was near or a little 
    above expected levels, except for a surge at the end of the first 
    quarter, and the federal funds rate remained close to the 3 percent 
    level that had prevailed for an extended period.

[SECTION]

Short-term interest rates changed little over the period 
    since the March meeting. Long-term rates rose considerably early in 
    the period when a sharp increase in average hourly earnings and some 
    upward pressure on commodity prices sparked fears among market 
    participants of a buildup in inflation pressures. Subsequently, 
    despite growing doubts about the fate of the deficit reduction 
    program, bond yields declined in response to a series of more 
    favorable readings on price behavior and to indications of a slowing 
    of the economic expansion. Adverse news about consumer and producer 
    prices rekindled inflation concerns late in the period, and bond rates 
    once again moved higher. On balance, most long-term market rates rose 
    somewhat over the period. Despite unexpectedly favorable earnings 
    reports for many firms, major indexes of stock prices were narrowly 
    mixed over the period.

[SECTION]

In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat on 
    balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar depreciated 
    considerably more against the Japanese yen than against the German 
    mark. A variety of factors contributed to the dollar's weakness, 
    including indications of renewed sluggishness in U.S. economic 
    activity, diminished prospects for a fiscal stimulus package, and 
    market perceptions over much of the intermeeting period of limited 
    official support for concerted actions to support the dollar against 
    the yen. After falling to a historical low against the yen in late 
    April, the dollar tended to stabilize following Treasury Secretary 
    Bentsen's clarification of the Administration's exchange rate policy 
    and intervention purchases of dollars against yen in a coordinated 
    operation. Later in the period, the dollar rose somewhat against 
    European currencies as the outlook for economic activity in Europe 
    became more pessimistic.

[SECTION]

M2 contracted slightly on balance over March and April, 
    while M3 was unchanged over the two months; both monetary aggregates 
    increased substantially in early May. Much of the weakness in M2 over 
    the March-April period owed to a smaller volume of nonwithheld tax 
    payments in April of this year that reduced the need for a buildup in 
    deposits to fund these payments. Abstracting from this temporary 
    depressant, weak underlying growth in M2 continued to reflect the 
    relatively attractive returns available on capital market instruments 
    such as bond and stock mutual funds, which experienced heavy inflows 
    during the two-month period. Total domestic nonfinancial debt 
    expanded somewhat further through March.

[SECTION]

The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested 
    that economic activity would grow at a moderate pace and that such 
    growth would foster a gradual reduction in margins of unemployed labor 
    and capital. The projection continued to incorporate the essential 
    elements of the Administration's fiscal package, excluding that 
    portion of the short-run stimulus initiative that seemed unlikely to 
    be enacted by the Congress. Although the outlook for fiscal policy 
    now seemed somewhat more contractionary than earlier, the sizable 
    declines in long-term interest rates that had occurred in recent 
    months were expected to support substantial additional gains in 
    business and residential investment. Moreover, the increasingly 
    favorable financial environment associated with expected further 
    easing of credit supply constraints and the ongoing strengthening of 
    balance sheets would tend to buttress private spending on housing, 
    consumer durables, and business equipment. Increases in export demand 
    would be damped in the near term by the continuing weakness in the 
    economies of the major industrialized countries. The persisting slack 
    in resource utilization was expected to be associated with a return to 
    more subdued price increases after a spurt earlier in the year.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    economic conditions, the members focused with some concern on the 
    evidence of a slower economic expansion and a higher rate of inflation 
    since late 1992. While recent indicators of economic activity were 
    disappointing, the expansion nonetheless appeared to have sustainable 
    momentum and the members generally viewed moderate growth in line 
    with, or perhaps a bit below, their February forecasts as a reasonable 
    expectation. At the same time, several emphasized that the outlook 
    was subject to substantial uncertainty stemming to an important extent 
    from the unsettled course of legislation aimed at reducing the federal 
    deficit. Members expressed particular concern about the rise in 
    various measures of inflation over the past several months. The 
    increase seemed to reflect temporary factors and a worsening in inflationary expectations rather than any significant change in economic 
    fundamentals. Accordingly, it was premature in the view of many 
    members to conclude that the inflationary trend had tilted upward. 
    Even so, higher inflation expectations, if sustained, would be 
    detrimental to economic performance, and the risks of an uptrend in 
    inflation clearly had increased.

[SECTION]

In their review of business developments across the nation, 
    members continued to report uneven conditions ranging from apparently 
    moderate gains in some parts of the country to mixed or marginally 
    declining activity in others. Business confidence had deteriorated 
    in many areas and firms were trimming or putting on hold new or 
    expanded spending programs pending a resolution of federal tax and 
    spending proposals, including prospective health care reform, and the 
    outcome of proposed tax legislation in some states as well. Cautious 
    business attitudes were reflected in continuing efforts to constrain 
    costs and to hold down or reduce employment levels, notably of 
    permanent workers in light of the large non-wage costs associated with 
    full-time workers. Accordingly, while some job growth was occurring, 
    especially outside major firms and the defense sector, business firms 
    generally appeared disposed to continue to meet increases in demand 
    through overtime work and temporary workers, and members anticipated 
    that such attitudes were likely to persist in the absence of a major 
    improvement in business confidence.

[SECTION]

As reflected in the available data for the national economy, 
    anecdotal reports from around the country suggested generally lackluster retail sales over the first four months of the year. To an 
    extent, this development probably involved some retrenchment in 
    consumer spending following an unsustainable surge during the latter 
    part of 1992. In some parts of the country, unusually severe weather 
    conditions also had served to hold down retail sales earlier this year 
    and recovery from that slowdown had tended to be limited thus far, 
    especially outside the automotive sector. Looking ahead, the members 
    continued to anticipate that consumer spending would provide moderate 
    support for a sustained economic expansion.

[SECTION]

Despite the cautious business attitudes about the economic 
    outlook, spending for business equipment had continued to help 
    maintain the expansion. Encouraged in part by relatively low interest 
    rates, receptive financial markets, and the more aggressive lending 
    policies of some depository institutions, many firms were upgrading 
    equipment to reduce costs and improve their product offerings. 
    Concurrently, however, numerous firms reported that they were holding 
    off on making major new investment commitments and in some cases were 
    revising down earlier expansion plans in light of prevailing economic 
    uncertainties, notably those generated by the current legislative 
    debate about federal taxes and spending. Nonresidential construction 
    remained uneven and on the whole relatively subdued across the nation. 
    The construction of new office structures was likely to stay depressed 
    in much of the country as overcapacity continued to be worked down, 
    but members saw indications of some strengthening in industrial and 
    commercial building activity and in public works projects in some 
    areas.

[SECTION]

Turning to the outlook for the nation's trade balance, some 
    members referred to quite gloomy assessments from business contacts 
    and other sources regarding current economic conditions in a number of 
    major industrial nations and the associated prospect of little or no 
    growth in U.S. exports to such countries. While total U.S. exports 
    might continue to expand, reflecting sizable gains in some parts of 
    the world, imports probably would grow at a somewhat faster pace, 
    given moderate expansion in domestic demand in line with the members' 
    expectations. At the same time, members expressed concern about the 
    potential impact of growing protectionist sentiment on current trade 
    negotiations and on the longer-run outlook for domestic industries and 
    parts of the country that relied on foreign trade.

[SECTION]

With regard to the inflation situation, members commented 
    that it remained difficult to find a satisfactory explanation for the 
    faster-than-projected increases in price measures thus far this year. 
    Although temporary anomalies seemed to be involved, including 
    measurement problems and special factors boosting some prices, higher 
    inflation expectations also might have been playing a key role. The 
    latter seemed to have intensified in the last month or two, perhaps as 
    a result of growing concerns that significant deficit-reduction 
    legislation might not be enacted. Strong competitive pressures in 
    many markets, including competition from foreign producers, still 
    appeared to be restraining or precluding price increases by many 
    business firms, but efforts to raise prices seemed to be encountering 
    somewhat less resistance recently than earlier in the economic 
    expansion. Some price increases appeared to be associated with the 
    earlier surge in demand, and in the case of one key industry higher 
    prices had been facilitated by the implementation of import 
    restrictions. The downtrend in labor compensation inflation also 
    seemed to have stalled in recent months. Against this background, a 
    considerable degree of uncertainty surrounded the outlook for 
    inflation and the members differed to some extent with regard to the 
    most likely outcome. A number of members, while they did not rule out 
    the possibility of a more favorable result, stressed the risk that a 
    faster rate of inflation might well tend to be sustained. Others gave 
    more emphasis to the still considerable slack in labor and product 
    markets and to the restrained growth in broad measures of money and 
    credit. In this view, an inflation rate in the quarters ahead more in 
    line with their earlier forecasts was still a reasonable expectation 
    even though the average rate for the year as a whole was likely to be 
    higher than they had forecast at the start of the year.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, many of the members commented that recent price and wage 
    developments were troubling but did not point persuasively at this 
    juncture toward an extended period of higher inflation. In light of 
    underlying economic and financial conditions, the upturn in inflation 
    expectations and the somewhat quickened pace of inflation might well 
    prove to be temporary. The economy was expanding, but the pace had 
    slowed in recent months. On the other hand, the potential for a 
    sustained increase in the rate of inflation could not be dismissed. 
    Waiting too long to counter any emerging uptrend in inflation or 
    further worsening in inflationary expectations would exacerbate 
    inflationary pressures and require more substantial and more disruptive policy moves later. Indeed, in one view sensitive commodity 
    prices and other key measures of inflation already indicated the need 
    for a prompt move toward restraint, especially in the context of the 
    Committee's objective of fostering progress toward price stability. 
    However, the other members all supported a proposal to maintain an 
    unchanged degree of pressure on reserve positions at this time.

[SECTION]

In the course of the Committee's discussion, the members 
    took account of a staff analysis that pointed to a considerable pickup 
    in the growth of M2 and M3 over the months of May and June. Such 
    strengthening, which appeared to have emerged in early May, was 
    associated in part with the reversal of earlier tax-related 
    distortions and with a surge in prepayments of mortgage-backed 
    securities. Monetary growth was expected to revert to a more modest 
    pace over subsequent months, and the members recognized that in any 
    event the interpretation of monetary growth rates needed to be 
    approached with considerable caution in a period when traditional 
    relationships of such growth to aggregate measures of economic 
    performance were not reliable. In present circumstances, M2 and M3 no 
    longer seemed to be good barometers of underlying liquidity, which 
    appeared to be ample. One member expressed the view that the 
    relatively robust growth of M1 and reserves served as a better 
    indicator of the thrust of monetary policy than did the broader 
    monetary aggregates.

[SECTION]

In the view of a majority of the members, wage and price 
    developments over recent months were sufficiently worrisome to warrant 
    positioning policy for a move toward restraint should signs of 
    intensifying inflation continue to multiply. In addition to new 
    information on prices and costs, such signs could include developments 
    in markets affected by inflation psychology, such as those for bonds, 
    foreign exchange, and sensitive commodities, all of which would need 
    to be monitored carefully. These members supported a directive that 
    incorporated a greater predilection to tighten than to ease over the 
    intermeeting period. Given the special nature of current inflation 
    concerns and attendant uncertainties, however, the Committee agreed 
    with a proposal by the Chairman that an intermeeting consultation 
    would be appropriate in the event that a tightening move were to be 
    contemplated during this period. If a policy tightening action were 
    not needed, an asymmetric directive would nonetheless underscore the 
    Committee's concern about recent inflation readings and its judgment 
    that a policy to encourage progress toward price stability would 
    promote sustained economic growth. In the event that a tightening 
    action became necessary, such action could help to moderate 
    inflationary expectations, with positive implications over time for 
    long-term interest rates and the performance of the economy. Monetary 
    policy would still be stimulative after a modest tightening move in 
    that such a move would leave short-term interest rates close to or 
    even below their year-ago levels in real terms, given the interim rise 
    in inflation.

[SECTION]

Some members preferred to retain a directive that did not 
    incorporate a presumption about the likely direction of a change in 
    policy, if any, during the intermeeting period. They were concerned 
    that adopting a biased directive might prove to be an overreaction to 
    temporary factors and to a short-lived upturn in inflationary 
    sentiment that was not warranted by underlying economic conditions. 
    They noted that, if called for by intermeeting developments, a move 
    toward restraint could be implemented from a symmetric directive. 
    More fundamentally, they believed that the circumstances surrounding 
    the recent performance of the economy and the uncertainties about 
    price developments suggested the need for considerable caution before 
    any policy tightening was implemented and that such a policy move 
    should be carried out only in the light of information that pointed 
    clearly to the emergence of higher inflation. Nonetheless, all but 
    one of these members could accept an asymmetric directive on the 
    understanding that the Committee would have a chance to discuss any 
    possible policy action.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but two 
    of the members indicated that they preferred or could accept a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that included a bias toward possible firming 
    of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in 
    the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
    and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided 
    that slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or 
    slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 
    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this 
    meeting were expected to be consistent with appreciable growth in the 
    broader monetary aggregates over the second quarter.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank 
    of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that the economic expansion has slowed in recent 
      months. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose only 
      slightly over March and April after registering sizable 
      increases earlier in the year, and the civilian 
      unemployment rate remained at 7.0 percent. Industrial 
      production was little changed in March and April after 
      posting solid gains in previous months. Retail sales 
      increased substantially in April but were about 
      unchanged on balance for the year to date. Housing 
      starts picked up in April. Incoming data on orders and 
      shipments of nondefense capital goods suggest a further 
      brisk advance in outlays for business equipment, while 
      nonresidential construction has remained soft. The 
      nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit in January-February was slightly below its average level in the 
      fourth quarter. Increases in wages and prices have 
      been appreciably larger this year than in the second 
      half of 1992.

Short-term interest rates have changed little 
      since the Committee meeting on March 23 while bond 
      yields have risen somewhat. In foreign exchange 
      markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in 
      terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat 
      on balance over the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

After contracting during the first quarter, M2 was 
      unchanged in April while M3 turned up; both aggregates 
      increased substantially in early May. Total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt expanded somewhat further through 
      March.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in February established ranges for growth of 
      M2 and M3 of 2 to 6 percent and 1/2 to 4-1/2 percent 
      respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1992 
      to the fourth quarter of 1993. The Committee expects 
      that developments contributing to unusual velocity 
      increases are likely to persist during the year. The 
      monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 
      the year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will 
      continue to be evaluated in the light of progress 
      toward price level stability, movements in their 
      velocities, and developments in the economy and 
      financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
      might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with appreciable growth in the broader 
      monetary aggregates over the second quarter.

      Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.

Votes against this action: Messrs. Angell 
      and Boehne.

[SECTION]

Mr. Angell dissented because he believed that the persisting 
    indications of rising inflation and the related deterioration in 
    inflationary psychology called for a prompt move to tighten monetary 
    policy. In his view, low real interest rates, a very steep yield 
    curve, a surprisingly weak exchange value of the dollar along with the 
    confirming price behavior of inflation-sensitive commodities such as 
    gold underscored the need for Committee action to signal the System's 
    continuing commitment to the eventual achievement of price stability. 
    In his opinion, progress toward lower inflation was not likely in 1993 
    and 1994 in the absence of a monetary policy that was sufficiently 
    restrictive to check inflationary expectations. He added that history 
    demonstrated that a monetary policy focused primarily on developments 
    in the real economy ran the risk of waiting too long to counter a 
    worsening in inflationary expectations and thus requiring more 
    substantial and possibly more disruptive policy changes later.

[SECTION]

Mr. Boehne supported a steady policy course, but he 
    dissented because he objected to a directive that was biased toward 
    tightening. Although recent developments suggested that inflation 
    would be somewhat higher and real growth somewhat lower during the 
    year than had been expected earlier, he did not believe recent data 
    indicated a fundamental shift in the outlook for inflation or the 
    economy. He was concerned that adopting a biased directive might 
    prove to be an overreaction to temporary factors affecting the 
    inflation rate and inflationary sentiment. In his view, underlying 
    economic conditions did not point toward an extended period of higher 
    inflation. While the pace of economic growth conceivably could 
    quicken, it seemed just as likely that the tempo of business and 
    consumer spending could diminish in the face of uncertainty about the 
    stance of fiscal policy, particularly with regard to potential tax 
    increases. Given these uncertainties, he had a strong preference for 
    keeping an open mind about possible Committee action during the 
    intermeeting period and, accordingly, favored a balanced policy 
    directive.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would 
    be held on Tuesday-Wednesday, July 6-7, 1993.
