By unanimous vote, the following officers of the Federal Open 
    Market Committee were elected to serve until the election of their 
    successors at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee 
    after December 31, 1995, with the understanding that should they 
    discontinue their official connection with the Board of Governors or 
    with a Federal Reserve Bank, they would cease to have any official 
    connection with the Federal Open Market Committee:

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was 
    selected to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account 
    until the adjournment of the first meeting of the Committee after 
    December 31, 1995.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, Peter R. Fisher was selected to serve at 
    the pleasure of the Committee as Manager, System Open Market Account, 
    on the understanding that his selection was subject to being 
    satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

Secretary's note: Advice subsequently was received 
      that the selection of Mr. Fisher was satisfactory to 
      the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
      New York.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal 
    Open Market Committee held on December 20, 1994, were approved.

[SECTION]

The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on 
    developments in foreign exchange markets since the December meeting. 
    There were no market transactions for System Account during this 
    period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.

[SECTION]

The Manager also reported on developments in domestic 
    financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period 
    December 20, 1994, through January 31, 1995. By unanimous vote, the 
    Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
    financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the 
    intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
    information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested a strong 
    further rise in economic activity during the closing months of 1994. 
    Although consumer spending appeared to be less buoyant and housing 
    demand had softened somewhat, growth in business investment, exports, 
    and inventories remained brisk. Industrial production and payroll 
    employment continued to record substantial gains. Broad indexes of 
    prices for consumer goods and services had risen moderately on average 
    over recent months despite shrinking margins of unemployed resources 
    and further sizable increases in the prices of many materials.

[SECTION]

Nonfarm payroll employment advanced considerably further in 
    December after a sharp rise in November. Substantial job gains were 
    recorded in December in service industries and in the retail trade 
    sector. Hiring in manufacturing was brisk for a third straight month, 
    with labor demand especially strong in motor vehicles, capital goods, 
    and electronic equipment. Construction payrolls slipped after a large 
    increase in November. The average workweek was unchanged in December, 
    but factory overtime edged back up, matching the highest level reached 
    in the history of this series. The civilian unemployment rate 
    declined to 5.4 percent.

[SECTION]

Industrial production registered another large advance in 
    December. Manufacturing accounted for all of the gain; an upturn in 
    mining production offset a decline in the output of utilities 
    associated with unseasonably warm weather. In manufacturing, the 
    output of motor vehicles and parts surged again and further solid 
    gains were recorded in the production of other goods. The large 
    advance in industrial output in December boosted rates of capacity 
    utilization above already high levels.

[SECTION]

Retail sales were reported to have changed little over 
    November and December after substantial advances in September and 
    October; the flattening of sales reflected sharply reduced increases 
    in outlays for non-auto consumer goods. Consumer spending on services 
    rose moderately on balance over November and December, with outlays 
    for energy services held down by unusually mild weather. Although 
    some indicators of housing demand had weakened, housing starts posted 
    sizable gains on balance over November and December; single-family 
    construction remained at a relatively high level despite the rise in 
    mortgage rates in 1994, and multifamily construction continued its 
    gradual recovery from the depressed levels of early 1993. The 
    regional pattern of starts activity suggested that favorable weather 
    accounted for little of the strength in December.

[SECTION]

Business fixed investment was estimated to have grown at a 
    very rapid pace in the fourth quarter, with a pickup indicated for 
    business spending on both equipment and nonresidential structures. 
    New orders for nondefense capital goods declined on balance over 
    November and December, but the large backlog of unfilled orders, 
    especially for computers, pointed to a continued strong expansion in 
    spending on business equipment in coming months. Nonresidential 
    construction activity was up considerably in November for a third 
    straight month, with increases in construction widespread by type of 
    structure. Recent data indicated that permits for nonresidential 
    construction were continuing to trend higher and perhaps were running 
    ahead of construction activity.

[SECTION]

Business inventory investment remained brisk in November; in 
    the aggregate, the buildup was in line with shipments and sales. In 
    manufacturing, stocks increased more rapidly in November, but the 
    ratio of stocks to shipments declined further and was at a 
    historically low level. In wholesale trade, inventories rose less 
    rapidly in November, but the inventory-to-sales ratio increased 
    further, although it remained within its range of recent years. 
    Inventory accumulation slowed a little at the retail level, and the 
    inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of 
    its range of recent years.

[SECTION]

The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
    widened somewhat further in November, and for October and November 
    combined the deficit was well above its average rate in the third 
    quarter. The value of exports of goods and services increased more 
    slowly in the October-November period than in the third quarter, 
    largely reflecting reduced growth of exported industrial supplies. 
    The rise in the value of imports of goods and services for the 
    October-November period was led by increased imports of non-oil 
    industrial supplies and automotive, capital, and consumer goods. 
    Available data for the fourth quarter of 1994 indicated continued 
    growth in economic activity, though perhaps at a somewhat slower pace, 
    in the major foreign industrial countries.

[SECTION]

Consumer price inflation slowed a little in December despite 
    a jump in food prices that was only partly offset by a decline in 
    energy prices. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices edged 
    up in December and rose significantly less in 1994 than in 1993. At 
    the producer level, prices of finished goods also advanced more slowly 
    in December, with a drop in energy prices balancing a surge in food 
    prices. Prices of finished goods other than food and energy increased 
    modestly in 1994 after being held down in 1993 by a sharp drop in the 
    prices of tobacco products. In contrast to prices of finished goods, 
    price inflation at earlier stages of production picked up in 1994. 
    For intermediate goods other than food and energy items, prices rose 
    at a faster rate in the second half of 1994, with the pickup most 
    clearly evident in materials used in manufacturing. Prices of crude 
    materials rose rapidly in the second half of 1994 and for the year as 
    a whole. Increases in labor costs remained moderate. Average hourly 
    earnings were little changed on balance over November and December, 
    and for the year as a whole they advanced only slightly more than in 
    1993. More broadly, hourly compensation of private industry workers 
    increased more slowly in the fourth quarter than in any of the 
    previous three quarters of 1994, and the rise for the year was 
    significantly less than in 1993.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on December 20, 1994, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that included a bias toward the possible 
    firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. 
    Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the 
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable 
    economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
    financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve 
    restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
    might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve 
    conditions associated with this directive were expected to be 
    consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary aggregates over 
    coming months.

[SECTION]

Open market operations during the intermeeting period were 
    directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions. With the need for seasonal credit diminishing over the 
    period, adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended lower but averaged 
    a little above anticipated levels. Near year-end, the Trading Desk 
    accommodated heavy demands for reserves through System RPs. The 
    federal funds rate averaged close to 5-1/2 percent during the 
    intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

Most other market interest rates declined slightly on balance 
    over the period after the December 20 meeting. Very short term 
    interest rates fell after the first of the year, reflecting the 
    disappearance of year-end premiums. More broadly, favorable news on 
    inflation and indications of some unexpected slowing in the growth of 
    final demands apparently led market participants to conclude that 
    further tightening of monetary policy, though still expected to be 
    substantial, would be less than previously thought and would be spread 
    over a longer period. Yields on tax-exempt instruments declined 
    considerably as concerns about the implications of Orange County's 
    problems for the financial condition of other municipal governments 
    abated. Strong earning reports for the fourth quarter boosted major 
    indexes of equity prices.

[SECTION]

In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined somewhat over 
    the intermeeting period. The dollar fell substantially against the 
    mark, which was buoyed by safe-haven inflows from weaker European 
    currencies, but dropped less against the yen. One factor that weighed 
    against the dollar was uncertainty about the consequences for the U.S. 
    economy of the sharp depreciation of the Mexican peso and the related 
    economic and financial problems in Mexico and other developing 
    economies; market participants expressed some concern that the crisis 
    might constrain U.S. monetary policy in the event of further domestic 
    inflation pressures and that the counterpart to the large prospective 
    reduction in the Mexican current account deficit would lie importantly 
    in the already substantial U.S. deficit.

[SECTION]

Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December, and data for 
    the first half of January suggested a further acceleration in that 
    month. Much of the pickup in M2 in December was due to rapid 
    expansion in overnight repurchase agreements and overnight 
    Eurodollars, which outweighed a further contraction of liquid accounts 
    associated in part with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by 
    shifting funds into market instruments. The faster growth of M3 
    reflected, in addition to the acceleration of its M2 component, bank 
    use of large CDs and nondeposit sources of funds to finance relatively 
    robust demands for credit. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
    fourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at the lower end of the Committee's 
    range for 1994 and M3 in the lower half of its range. Total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt had continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent 
    months, and for 1994 it was in the lower half of its monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
    growth of economic activity would slow substantially over the next 
    several quarters and for some period thereafter would average less 
    than the rate of increase in the economy's potential output. Consumer 
    spending was projected to be well sustained for a time but to be 
    restrained later by smaller gains in real incomes, the satisfaction of 
    pent-up demands, and the lagged effects of higher interest rates on 
    the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new equipment were 
    expected to decelerate substantially in response to higher financing 
    costs and slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was 
    anticipated to soften a little in response to slower growth in jobs 
    and income as well as to the increase that had occurred in mortgage 
    rates. Recent developments in Mexico were expected to cut into 
    exports in the near term, but the sustained economic growth elsewhere 
    would keep export demand on an uptrend. Although there was 
    considerable uncertainty regarding the fiscal outlook, in light of the 
    Congressional intent to cut the federal deficit the forecast 
    incorporated a somewhat greater degree of fiscal restraint than had 
    been built into recent forecasts. In the staff's judgment, the 
    economy currently was operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary 
    capacity, and there remained a substantial risk that inflation could 
    ratchet higher absent further monetary policy actions.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    economic developments, the members agreed that growth in economic 
    activity could be expected to moderate considerably over the course of 
    1995, although inflation was likely to be higher than in 1994. They 
    acknowledged that their current projections were subject to 
    substantial risks. The expansion continued to display appreciable 
    momentum and signs of slower growth were still quite limited and 
    tentative. Even so, the members remained persuaded that the lagged 
    effects of the policy tightening implemented over the course of 1994 
    would become increasingly evident in interest-sensitive sectors of the 
    economy as the year progressed. The projected moderation in the 
    growth of final demands, which probably would be concentrated at least 
    initially in the housing and consumer durables sectors, would 
    undoubtedly reinforce an expected cutback in inventory investment from 
    its unsustainable pace in recent quarters. A key uncertainty in the 
    outlook was whether the slowing in overall economic growth would be 
    sufficient to relieve the current pressures on labor and other 
    producer resources, which many members saw as portending higher 
    inflation, or, indeed, whether such pressures would intensify further. 
    Opinions differed to some degree with regard to both the likely extent 
    of the prospective slowing in economic growth and the outlook for 
    inflation. However, most of the members concluded that some rise in 
    inflation appeared probable over coming quarters, and they were 
    concerned that this upturn would not be reversed and could be extended 
    in the absence of further monetary restraint.

[SECTION]

In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee 
    establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt 
    aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank 
    presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual 
    projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and 
    inflation for the year 1995. Measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 
    to the fourth quarter of 1995, their forecasts of the growth in real 
    GDP had a central tendency of 2 to 3 percent, compared with a growth 
    rate of 4 percent estimated for 1994. Most of the members also 
    anticipated that economic expansion in line with their forecasts would 
    be associated with little change in the unemployment rate and their 
    projections of the rate in the fourth quarter of 1995 were centered in 
    a narrow range around 5-1/2 percent. The high levels of resource 
    utilization implied by these projections were viewed by most members 
    as likely to foster somewhat greater pressure on wages and prices. 
    Accordingly, projections of the rate of inflation, as indexed by the 
    consumer price index, had a central tendency of 3 to 3-1/2 percent for 
    the period from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 
    1995, compared with rates of about 2-3/4 percent in both 1993 and 
    1994.

[SECTION]

In their review of regional economic developments, members 
    referred to widespread evidence of further growth in business 
    activity, but a number also mentioned scattered signs of some 
    softening in a few areas or industries. Several emphasized, however, 
    that the anecdotal evidence did not currently point to any significant 
    moderation in the overall growth of the economy. With regard to 
    financial conditions, members commented that they saw little 
    indication that policy tightening actions over the past year were 
    constraining the availability of credit to any observable degree. 
    Despite higher interest rates, financial conditions remained broadly 
    supportive of further economic expansion. The performance of stock 
    market prices and the relatively narrow quality spreads in debt 
    markets attested to a considerable degree of confidence among 
    investors. Members also took note of the accommodative lending 
    policies of banking institutions. Those policies had encouraged rapid 
    growth in consumer and business loans and evidently were contributing 
    to the ongoing strength of the economic expansion. Some members 
    expressed concern that a number of banks might have eased their 
    lending standards unduly and thus assumed unwarranted risks in their 
    loan portfolios.

[SECTION]

In their assessment of developments in key sectors of the 
    economy, members referred to the sluggish behavior of non-auto retail 
    sales in November and December, but they also noted that the available 
    information on consumer spending during the first few weeks of this 
    year was inconclusive with regard to the possible emergence of a 
    slowing trend. Anecdotal commentary on retail sales was mixed, and 
    evidence of some decline in January sales of motor vehicles needed to 
    be evaluated with caution because of the introduction of a new 
    reporting method. Consumer confidence was at a high level, but some 
    members observed that consumer indebtedness had grown rapidly and was 
    likely to exert a retarding effect on consumer spending at some point. 
    In this regard, however, it was pointed out that rising consumer 
    incomes had kept debt service burdens from increasing significantly 
    thus far. On balance, the members believed that the growth in 
    consumer spending probably would slow over the forecast horizon though 
    such spending might be relatively well maintained for some period, 
    given the ongoing expansion in jobs and incomes and the ready 
    availability of financing to many consumers. In any event, the 
    outlook for this sector of the economy, which was critical to any 
    significant moderation in overall economic growth, was uncertain with 
    regard to both the timing and the extent of possible slowing.

[SECTION]

Housing construction was cited as potentially the most 
    important demand sector of the economy that was likely to contribute 
    to more moderate economic growth over the year ahead. As evidenced by 
    nationwide data through the end of 1994, single-family housing starts 
    had held up unexpectedly well despite sizable increases in home 
    mortgage rates, but anecdotal reports from around the country had 
    pointed to weakening demand for new homes for several months and 
    continued to do so. Against the background of current mortgage rate 
    levels and the rise that had occurred in home mortgage indebtedness, 
    the members continued to anticipate softening demand for housing, at 
    least in the single-family sector. The mild uptrend in the much 
    smaller multifamily sector was likely to continue for some period, 
    given low rental vacancy rates in a number of areas, and further 
    improvement in nonresidential construction was likely to offset to 
    some extent the overall slowing in housing construction.

[SECTION]

In the capital goods sector, real business-fixed investment 
    had strengthened further in the fourth quarter, and the members 
    believed, on the basis of rising order backlogs and the strength of 
    permits for new business construction, that considerable momentum had 
    carried into this year. While the growth in spending for business 
    equipment undoubtedly would moderate from its extraordinary pace over 
    an extended period, large business profits and the still relatively 
    low user cost of capital would tend to support appreciable further 
    growth in such investment in the context of elevated levels of 
    capacity utilization and ongoing efforts, induced by strong market 
    competition, to increase productivity. Moreover, nonresidential 
    construction was now trending higher, with particular strength evident 
    in industrial and commercial construction.

[SECTION]

The pace of inventory accumulation in recent quarters was 
    viewed as unsustainable and a decline in inventory investment was seen 
    as likely over the forecast horizon, though the precise timing and 
    extent were impossible to predict. While slower growth in final 
    demand might in most circumstances stimulate a relatively sharp 
    adjustment in inventory investment, members cited factors that could 
    mute the size of that adjustment and its effects on overall GDP. 
    These included relatively low inventory/sales ratios across much of 
    the economy and little anecdotal or other evidence of unintended 
    inventory accumulation. Moreover, because an unusually large share of 
    the inventory buildup in recent quarters appeared to involve imports, 
    a cutback in such investment should tend to have a smaller-than-usual 
    impact on domestic production. There was no current evidence that 
    inventory investment was slowing, and indeed recent data on business 
    loans at banks might suggest some acceleration in inventory 
    accumulation since the beginning of the year. Nonetheless, as more 
    moderate growth in final demand began to emerge, concerns about the 
    availability of materials used in the production process or stocks 
    needed to meet market demand should diminish, and business firms could 
    be expected to trim their demand for inventories, perhaps aggressively 
    for a time. Indeed, this sector of the economy might well account for 
    much of the slowing in the expansion for some period of time during 
    the year ahead.

[SECTION]

Fiscal policy was under active debate in the Congress, and 
    the members viewed the outcome of that debate as very uncertain. The 
    emergence of a moderately restrictive fiscal policy might be a 
    reasonable assumption to incorporate in current forecasts, albeit an 
    assumption that clearly was subject to a wide range of error. In any 
    event, any progress toward cutting future budget deficits was likely 
    to have a favorable effect on domestic financial markets and perhaps 
    also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets.

[SECTION]

Developments in Mexico and their possible repercussions in 
    other developing nations had negative implications for U.S. exports, 
    at least over the short run. Indeed, some members cited anecdotal 
    evidence that reduced trade with Mexico had already emerged since late 
    1994. Moreover, the effects of the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, seemed 
    to be disrupting trade with that nation in agricultural and other bulk 
    goods and was likely to continue doing so over the near term. Looking 
    beyond the months immediately ahead, the relatively robust growth 
    projected for many industrial countries together with the lower value 
    of the dollar should boost the nation's overall external trade 
    balance, though probably not to the extent of providing substantial 
    stimulus to the economy. One member observed that a number of 
    countries throughout the world faced the potential for important 
    changes in political conditions that could have adverse effects on 
    their growth and trading relationships, with possible repercussions on 
    U.S. exports.

[SECTION]

Members commented that the strong growth in economic activity 
    and high levels of resource utilization had fostered relatively rapid 
    increases in the prices of many raw materials and semi-finished goods 
    used in the production process, but contrary to numerous forecasts 
    these developments had not led thus far to a broad pickup in inflation 
    as measured by the prices of final goods and services. This favorable 
    development might be explained in part by lags in the inflation 
    transmission process and perhaps to some degree by various structural 
    changes and productivity improvements in recent years that may have 
    raised both the level and the rate of increase of the economy's 
    potential for sustained activity. Many members observed, however, 
    that it would not be prudent from a monetary policy standpoint to 
    assume that continued rapid economic growth and further pressures on 
    producer resources would not lead to rising inflation over the 
    quarters ahead. While competitive pressures still generally limited 
    the extent to which business firms could pass through rising costs of 
    raw materials and other producer inputs to the prices of final goods, 
    the members referred to increasingly numerous examples of successful 
    efforts to raise such prices and to apparently growing business 
    expectations that it would be possible to implement such increases 
    over the months ahead. On balance, the members generally were 
    persuaded that the economy had attained levels of labor and capital 
    utilization that implied a strong risk of rising inflation over coming 
    quarters.

[SECTION]

In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and 
    Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee 
    at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth of the monetary and 
    debt aggregates in 1995 that it had established on a tentative basis 
    at its meeting in July 1994. The tentative ranges included expansion 
    of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3, measured from the 
    fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The monitoring 
    range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set 
    provisionally at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The ranges for M2 and M3 
    were unchanged from those that the Committee had used in 1994, while 
    the range for debt was one percentage point lower.

[SECTION]

All the members endorsed a proposal to adopt the ranges that 
    the Committee had set on a tentative basis in July 1994. While some 
    acceleration in the growth of the broad monetary aggregates from the 
    pace in 1994 could be anticipated over the year ahead according to a 
    staff analysis, monetary expansion within the ranges in question 
    appeared to be consistent with the moderation in the expansion of 
    nominal GDP that the members were projecting for 1995 and that they 
    viewed as desirable to head off increasing inflation. Moreover, the 
    ranges for the broad monetary aggregates had been reduced over the 
    past decade to levels that, notably in the case of M2, should now be 
    consistent over long periods with the Committee's objectives for 
    stable prices and maximum sustainable economic growth. This outcome 
    would depend on the restoration over time of the historical velocity 
    patterns linking the monetary aggregates to broad measures of economic 
    performance, including a level velocity trend for M2. It was noted in 
    this regard that until recent years the growth of M3 had tended to 
    exceed that of M2--a pattern that seemed to be re-emerging--and 
    therefore a somewhat higher range might be set for M3 than for M2. 
    However, the members did not believe that a persuasive argument could 
    be made at this juncture for raising the M3 range, though they did not 
    want to rule out the option of doing so later, possibly when the 
    ranges were reviewed at midyear. Indeed, to make the change at this 
    point might convey a misleading message regarding the Committee's 
    policy intentions or its confidence in prospective monetary growth 
    relationships.

[SECTION]

The Committee also considered the potential advantages and 
    disadvantages of setting specific targets for bringing inflation down 
    and achieving price stability over time. Such targets might provide 
    an alternative or supplemental approach to the monetary growth ranges, 
    which had been found to be unreliable guides for monetary policy over 
    the past several years. The members discussed a number of aspects of 
    inflation targeting. On the one hand, such targeting would help to 
    anchor the conduct of monetary policy and progress in meeting these 
    objectives could enhance the credibility of the Federal Reserve and 
    perhaps reduce the overall cost of attaining price stability. On the 
    other hand, close adherence to preset inflation targets could unduly 
    constrain the Federal Reserve in its efforts to counteract the effects 
    of cyclical shortfalls in the performance of the economy. The members 
    agreed that the discussion had been helpful in outlining the issues 
    and that the subject should be revisited. It was noted in this 
    connection that the Committee might be asked to comment during the 
    months ahead on specific Congressional proposals for inflation 
    targeting.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of its discussion, all the members voted to 
    approve without change the tentative ranges for 1995 that the 
    Committee had established in July of last year. In keeping with its 
    usual procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would 
    review its ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions 
    warranted, in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the 
    aggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments. 
    Accordingly, the following longer-run policy statement for 1995 was 
    approved for inclusion in the domestic policy directive.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price 
      stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this 
      meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 
      1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, 
      measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth 
      quarter of 1995. The Committee anticipated that money 
      growth within these ranges would be consistent with its 
      broad policy objectives. The monitoring range for 
      growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered 
      to 3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the 
      monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in 
      the light of progress toward price level stability, 
      movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
      economy and financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, all the members indicated that they could support some 
    firming in reserve conditions, though a few preferred to delay such an 
    action pending the receipt within the next few weeks of significant 
    new information that could help the Committee to evaluate whether and 
    to what extent the economic expansion might be slowing. Most of the 
    members were convinced, however, that current monetary policy should 
    be adjusted promptly to a more clearly restrictive stance. In their 
    view, prompt action was needed to counter inflationary pressures and 
    inflationary expectations in an economy that already seemed to be 
    operating at, and perhaps beyond, sustainable capacity levels and to 
    be continuing to expand at a pace above its long-run potential. In 
    these circumstances, a delay in tightening policy would incur an 
    unacceptable risk of allowing further inflationary momentum to develop 
    in the economy and would require more tightening over time than might 
    otherwise be needed to achieve the Committee's objectives. Part of 
    the risk involved a potential further decline in the dollar at a time 
    when there already was considerable concern about rising pressures on 
    prices. Some tightening of policy at this meeting was generally 
    anticipated in markets, and a failure to take action now was likely in 
    the view of a number of members to raise questions about the 
    credibility of the System's anti-inflation resolve and to generate 
    some unsettlement in financial markets, notably in the foreign 
    exchange market where the dollar already appeared to be vulnerable to 
    further weakness. In terms of balancing the policy risks that were 
    involved, a prompt move would provide some insurance against what 
    these members viewed as the principal risk in current circumstances--that of rising inflation. The risks of excessive tightening, while 
    not completely absent, were believed to be limited in light of the apparent strength and momentum of the expansion, which many 
    forecasters had underestimated over the past year. One member 
    expressed the view that while monetary growth had been damped, 
    continuing restraint on the growth of the narrow monetary aggregates 
    was desirable to offset a previous build-up in liquidity and help 
    assure that inflationary pressures would be contained.

[SECTION]

Members who saw an advantage in postponing a decision to 
    tighten policy commented that, in light of some scattered signs of a 
    moderating expansion, it would be helpful to wait for certain key 
    statistics that would become available within the next few weeks to 
    judge the extent of any moderation. Data on retail sales in January 
    might provide particular insights as to whether the softening in such 
    sales in November and December was persisting. The favorable news on 
    inflation in the fourth quarter had lessened concerns about an 
    immediate inflation threat, and if the incoming information confirmed 
    the need for further tightening, the short delay in implementing it 
    would have only a minimal cost. In addition, an increase in monetary 
    restraint would be likely to exacerbate the problems of Mexico and 
    perhaps to some extent those of Canada and would have potentially 
    adverse implications for U.S. trade with both of these key trading 
    partners. Because the probability that incoming information would 
    counsel against any further policy tightening was certainly less than 
    50 percent so that only a matter of timing was likely to be involved, 
    these members indicated that they would join with the other members in 
    voting to tighten policy at this meeting.

[SECTION]

Concerning the possible need to adjust policy during the 
    intermeeting period, the members were unanimously in favor of adopting 
    a symmetric directive. Given a decision to implement some tightening 
    in monetary policy at this meeting, they did not believe that there 
    should be a presumption toward possible further tightening in this 
    period. A number of members observed that further monetary restraint 
    might not be needed if, in line with their expectations, the incoming 
    evidence on the performance of the economy suggested that the 
    expansion was moderating sufficiently for the economy to return to a 
    growth path consistent with containing inflation pressures. In any 
    event, the Committee's most difficult decision over the next several 
    quarters was likely to be that of determining when further tightening 
    was no longer desirable.

[SECTION]

Prior to the end of the meeting, the members were apprised of 
    a disposition on the part of the Board of Governors to approve an 
    increase of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate that was pending 
    at several Federal Reserve Banks. In the event that such an increase 
    was approved by the Board, the members agreed that open market 
    operations should be conducted so as to allow that increase to be 
    reflected fully in reserve markets.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members indicated that they could support a directive that called for 
    increasing somewhat the degree of pressure on reserve positions. In 
    the implementation of this policy, account would be taken of a 
    possible increase of 1/2 percentage in the discount rate that was 
    under consideration by the Board of Governors. The members also 
    agreed that the directive should not include any presumption about 
    possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. 
    Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful 
    consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the 
    Committee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve 
    restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. 
    According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at 
    this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 
    over coming months.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
    New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting 
      suggests a strong further rise in economic activity 
      during the closing months of 1994. Nonfarm payroll 
      employment was up considerably further in December 
      after a sharp increase in November, and the 
      civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.4 percent. 
      Industrial production registered another large 
      advance in December and capacity utilization 
      continued to move up from already high levels. 
      Current estimates indicate little change in retail 
      sales over November and December, while housing 
      starts posted sizable gains on balance over the two 
      months. Orders for nondefense capital goods point 
      to a continued strong expansion in spending on 
      business equipment; permits for nonresidential 
      construction have been trending appreciably higher. 
      The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and 
      services widened somewhat in October-November from 
      its average rate in the third quarter. Prices of 
      many materials have continued to move up rapidly, 
      but broad indexes of prices for consumer goods and 
      services have increased moderately on average over 
      recent months.

[SECTION]

Most market interest rates have declined 
      slightly on balance since the Committee meeting on 
      December 20, 1994. In foreign exchange markets, 
      the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of 
      the other G-10 currencies has declined somewhat 
      over the intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has 
      depreciated sharply against the dollar.

[SECTION]

Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in December 
      and January. From the fourth quarter of 1993 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1994, M2 grew at a rate at 
      the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 and M3 
      at a rate in the lower half of its range for the 
      year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has 
      continued to expand at a moderate rate in recent 
      months, and for the year 1994 it grew at a rate in 
      the lower half of its monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
      monetary and financial conditions that will foster 
      price stability and promote sustainable growth in 
      output. In furtherance of these objectives, the 
      Committee at this meeting established ranges for 
      growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 
      percent respectively, measured from the fourth 
      quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The 
      Committee anticipated that money growth within 
      these ranges would be consistent with its broad 
      policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth 
      of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 
      3 to 7 percent for the year. The behavior of the 
      monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
      in the light of progress toward price level 
      stability, movements in their velocities, and 
      developments in the economy and financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the implementation of policy for the 
      immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase 
      somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
      positions, taking account of a possible increase in 
      the discount rate. In the context of the 
      Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
      and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful 
      consideration to economic, financial, and monetary 
      developments, somewhat greater reserve restraint or 
      somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.

Temporary Increase in Reciprocal Currency Agreement with the Bank of 
    Mexico and Increase in Agreement to "Warehouse" Foreign Currencies

[SECTION]

On December 30, 1994, the Committee approved a temporary 
    increase from $3 billion to $4-1/2 billion in the System's reciprocal 
    currency (swap) agreement with the Bank of Mexico and it also approved 
    the activation of that agreement. The Committee approved a further 
    temporary increase of $1-1/2 billion and activation of that amount at 
    this meeting, thereby raising the swap arrangement with the Bank of 
    Mexico to a level of $6 billion, consisting of the regular $3 billion 
    line and a special $3 billion line. The special $3 billion line may 
    be drawn on until January 31, 1996. Drawings would be for three-month 
    periods and could be renewed a maximum of three times. Once a drawing 
    on the special line is repaid, the size of the line will be reduced 
    pari passu. All drawings on the special line will have to be repaid 
    no later than January 31, 1997. The terms and conditions for use of 
    the permanent $3 billion swap facility with the Bank of Mexico remain 
    unchanged and drawings, once repaid, will require Committee action 
    prior to subsequent use. The Treasury has undertaken to assure the 
    repayment of any swap drawing by the Bank of Mexico on the $6 billion 
    in lines that is outstanding more than 12 months.

The Committee also approved at this meeting an increase from 
    $5 billion to $20 billion in the amount of eligible foreign currencies 
    that the System is prepared to "warehouse" for the Treasury and the 
    Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The purpose of the warehousing 
    facility, which has been in place for many years, is to supplement the U.S. dollar resources of the Treasury and the ESF for financing 
    purchases of foreign currencies and related international operations. 
    The size of the warehousing facility had ranged up to $15 billion in 
    past years, but it was reduced to $5 billion in February 1992. The 
    expansion of the warehousing agreement at this meeting was intended to 
    facilitate U.S. participation in the Multilateral Program to Restore 
    Financial Stability in Mexico, announced by President Clinton on 
    January 31, 1995, by warehousing up to $20 billion in German marks and 
    Japanese yen held by the Treasury through the ESF. The Committee will 
    review each year the need to maintain this level of warehousing 
    authority in light of the progress and needs of the Program.

Members who voted to approve these proposals were persuaded 
    that the nature and severity of Mexico's financial problems could not 
    be contained without making available substantial financial assistance 
    to the Government of Mexico. The financial support provided by the 
    United States would be accompanied by similar assistance from the IMF 
    and would be conditioned on Mexico's commitment to implement major 
    changes in its economic policies, including monetary policy. It was 
    emphasized during the Committee's discussion that the United States 
    had a strong interest in encouraging the restoration of stability in 
    Mexico for numerous reasons, including the growth of trade between the 
    two nations and the resulting creation of jobs in both countries. 
    Moreover, Mexico's financial problems appeared to be spreading to a 
    number of other nations and adversely affecting the dollar in the 
    foreign exchange markets. The participation of the Federal Reserve in 
    this effort was strongly endorsed by the Administration and the 
    overall program had the support of the bipartisan leadership in the 
    Congress. Apart from temporary financial resources, the Federal 
    Reserve was in a position to supply expertise and experience that were 
    not readily available elsewhere. On the negative side, the members 
    acknowledged that there could be no assurances that the rescue program 
    would succeed, but its scale, its multinational character, and the 
    apparent willingness of Mexican officials to pursue the difficult 
    policies needed to assure success were grounds for optimism.

[SECTION]

Messrs. Lindsey and Melzer dissented with respect to 
    increases in both the swap line and the warehousing arrangement with 
    the Exchange Stabilization Fund. They did not believe that the 
    Committee had been provided sufficient information to assess whether 
    developments in Mexico threatened U.S. financial stability, a possible 
    justification for increased central bank lending on a short-term 
    basis, Furthermore, they considered it inappropriate for the Federal 
    Reserve to participate, directly or indirectly, in intermediate to 
    long-term financing to facilitate debt restructuring. They were 
    concerned that such participation in a fiscal policy matter might 
    compromise, or appear to compromise, the independence of the monetary 
    policy process. Mr. Lindsey added that the latter risks were 
    significantly enhanced given the absence of Congressional 
    authorization or more general public support for these measures.

Disclosure Policy.

[SECTION]

At this meeting, the Committee decided to retain the procedures that it had followed over the past year for providing greater 
    information to the public about its policy actions and discussions. 
    It was the judgment of the members that these procedures strike an 
    appropriate balance between making the Committee's decisions and 
    deliberations accessible to the public as soon and as fully as 
    feasible, while safeguarding the Committee's flexibility in policymaking and preserving an unfettered deliberative process. The 
    procedures in question involve the prompt announcement of the 
    Committee's decisions and the release of minutes and transcripts of 
    FOMC meetings.

[SECTION]

The Committee will continue its practice of announcing each 
    change in the stance of monetary policy in a press release on the day 
    the decision is made. This practice removes any uncertainty about the 
    Committee's intentions in regard to reserve conditions and enables all 
    financial market participants and others to receive the information at 
    the same time. When no change is made at a meeting, the Committee 
    normally will announce only the time when the meeting ended and that 
    there are no further announcements. However, in some infrequent 
    circumstances, the Committee may decide to issue a statement even when 
    no change in policy is made.

[SECTION]

The full substance of the Committee's deliberations relating 
    to each policy decision will continue to be reported, as is the 
    current practice, in comprehensive minutes of the meeting that are 
    released two or three days following the next regularly scheduled 
    meeting. For historians and other students of monetary policymaking, 
    those minutes will be supplemented by lightly edited transcripts of 
    the discussion at each Committee meeting. For recent and future 
    meetings, transcripts for an entire year will be released with a five-year lag; earlier transcripts dating back to March 1976 will continue 
    to be released on an ongoing basis as the light editing process is 
    completed. Continuing the practice followed since the beginning of 
    1994, transcripts prepared by the Committee's Secretariat will be 
    circulated to each participant to verify his or her comments, and only 
    changes that clarify meaning, such as the correction of grammar or 
    transcription errors, will be permitted. A limited amount of material 
    will be withheld from the publicly released version of these 
    documents, primarily to protect the confidentiality of foreign and 
    domestic sources of information that likely would be lost if the 
    information they provide were to be made public. As required by law, 
    a complete, unredacted version of the transcript of each meeting will 
    be turned over to the National Archives after 30 years have elapsed.

[SECTION]

For the purpose of preparing the minutes and transcripts, the 
    discussions of monetary policy at Committee meetings will continue to 
    be recorded. The tape recorder may be turned off at the Chairman's 
    discretion when the Committee deals with issues unrelated to monetary 
    policy, such as organizational and personnel matters. The transcripts 
    will indicate that the tape recorder has been turned off and the 
    minutes will provide a summary description of the matters that were 
    discussed, As permitted by the National Records Act, the recordings 
    and unedited transcripts will be discarded after all the participants 
    at the meeting have reviewed and corrected, as necessary, the 
    transcripts prepared by the Secretariat.
