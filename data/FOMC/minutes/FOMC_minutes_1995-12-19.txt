1. Did not attend portion of meeting covering the monetary policy 
      discussion.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal 
    Open Market Committee held on November 15, 1995, were approved.

[SECTION]

The Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account, 
    conducted by the Board's Division of Reserve Bank Operations and 
    Payment Systems as of the close of business on September 29, 1995, was 
    accepted.

[SECTION]

The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on 
    developments in foreign exchange markets during the period November 
    15, 1995, through December 18, 1995. There were no System open market 
    transactions in foreign currencies during this period, and thus no 
    vote was required of the Committee.

[SECTION]

The Manager also reported on developments in domestic 
    financial markets and on System open market transactions in government 
    securities and federal agency obligations during the period 
    November 15, 1995, through December 18, 1995. By unanimous vote, the 
    Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the Committee authorized the renewal 
    until December 13, 1996, of the System's regular reciprocal currency 
    ("swap") arrangement of $3 billion with the Bank of Mexico and the 
    System's participation in the North American Framework Agreement 
    with the monetary authorities of Canada and Mexico. Both were due to 
    terminate on January 31, 1996. The additional temporary $3 billion 
    swap arrangement with the Bank of Mexico, approved by the Committee on 
    February 1, 1995, would lapse on January 31, 1996, in line with its 
    original terms.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
    financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the 
    intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
    information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information available at this meeting suggested that the 
    expansion of economic activity had slowed substantially after a strong 
    gain in such activity during the third quarter. Data on employment 
    and aggregate hours worked since late summer were consistent with 
    moderate further increases in overall economic activity. Industrial 
    production had changed little on balance after a sizable rise in the 
    third quarter. On the spending side, robust advances in business 
    fixed investment continued to provide considerable impetus to the 
    economy. The available information on consumer expenditures pointed 
    to somewhat reduced gains in recent months, and indicators of housing 
    demand suggested on balance that activity in housing markets had 
    tended to stabilize after several months of considerable 
    strengthening. Consumer prices had risen relatively slowly in recent 
    months, while increases in labor compensation had remained 
    comparatively subdued.

[SECTION]

Nonfarm payroll employment continued to grow at a pace 
    roughly in line with the expansion of the labor force in recent 
    months, with gains concentrated in the private service-producing 
    sectors. The published information indicated some further declines in 
    factory and government jobs in October and November. Although 
    aggregate hours of private production workers fell in November, they 
    remained appreciably above their average level in the third quarter. 
    The unemployment rate edged up to 5.6 percent in November, equaling 
    its average for the third quarter.

[SECTION]

Industrial production was little changed on balance over 
    October and November after a sizable increase in the third quarter. A 
    decline in October was largely accounted for by a strike at a major 
    aircraft manufacturer and that strike, very recently settled, had also 
    exerted a slightly depressing effect on production in November. 
    Production of motor vehicles and parts also fell, on net, in October 
    and November. Further growth outside the aircraft and motor vehicle 
    industries was paced by continuing strength in the production of 
    business equipment. Outside manufacturing, the output of utilities 
    was boosted in November by demand associated with unusually cold 
    weather.

[SECTION]

Business fixed investment was continuing to grow at a rapid 
    pace, with much of the strength stemming from the persisting and 
    vigorous expansion in spending for office and computing equipment. 
    However, the recent gains in total business investment had moderated 
    from the extraordinary pace evident in 1994 and early 1995, and they 
    also were less widespread among major categories of business equipment 
    than they had been earlier. New orders for nondefense capital goods 
    other than computers and aircraft had leveled out, although shipments 
    were being maintained at high levels by still-large backlogs of 
    unfilled orders. Producers of aircraft had received very sizable new 
    orders recently, but shipments of completed aircraft had been held 
    back in recent months by the strike at a major firm. Outlays for 
    nonresidential construction were continuing to advance briskly, with 
    construction of commercial structures posting sizable increases 
    recently. Overall drilling and mining activity also had continued to 
    move higher, led by increased exploration for natural gas.

[SECTION]

Total nominal retail sales rose considerably in November, 
    more than offsetting a drop in October; over the two months, retail 
    sales were advancing at a slower pace than the average rate in the 
    second and third quarters. Much of the November increase reflected 
    strong gains in sales of consumer durables, including improved sales 
    of motor vehicles. In the nondurables sector, a sizable rise in 
    November about reversed a decline in October. Recent surveys of 
    consumer sentiment pointed to generally positive attitudes.

[SECTION]

After having recorded robust advances during the third 
    quarter, most indicators of housing activity suggested little further 
    change more recently. However, considerable strength in mortgage 
    applications associated with lower mortgage rates, together with 
    survey indications of an upturn in house-buying intentions, pointed to 
    strengthening housing construction over coming months. Housing starts 
    were down in October, the latest month for which these data were 
    available, after a large increase in the third quarter.

[SECTION]

Data for October indicated a sizable accumulation of business 
    inventories. In manufacturing, stocks grew at a rate only moderately 
    below the brisk pace in the third quarter, and the rise continued to 
    be concentrated in the capital goods industries. The aggregate ratio 
    of inventories to sales in manufacturing was somewhat above the lows 
    in late 1994 and early 1995. In the wholesale sector, a buildup in 
    stocks of capital equipment accounted for the bulk of the accumulation 
    in October, and the inventory-to-sales ratio in this sector remained 
    on an uptrend. A sharp rise in retail inventories in October was led 
    by a large increase in stocks at auto dealers and at general 
    merchandise and apparel outlets. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the 
    retail sector as a whole was at its high for the year, but signs of 
    overstocking, apart from motor vehicles, were limited.

[SECTION]

After having strengthened appreciably in the third quarter, 
    federal government purchases were now lagging and exerting some 
    retarding effect on overall economic activity. The decline in federal 
    purchases in part represented the transitory effects of government 
    shutdowns and the restraining effects of spending cuts imposed by 
    continuing resolutions and by curtailed appropriations in bills that 
    already had been enacted into law. At the state and local government 
    levels, however, available data pointed to continued, relatively 
    strong growth in purchases.

[SECTION]

The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
    changed little in September (latest data available). Measured on a 
    quarterly average basis, however, the deficit declined substantially 
    in the third quarter, with the reduction about equally divided between 
    a rise in the value of exports and a drop in the value of imports. 
    Increases in exports were widespread among the major categories of 
    trade, while reductions in imports were concentrated in categories in 
    which there had been large gains in the second quarter. Available 
    data pointed to subdued growth in most of the major foreign industrial 
    countries in the second half of 1995.

[SECTION]

Consumer prices had risen more slowly on balance in recent 
    months than they had during the first half of the year. In November, 
    the total index for consumer prices was unchanged, and consumer prices 
    excluding food and energy were up only slightly. In contrast, 
    producer prices of finished goods registered a relatively large 
    increase in November, and the component of this index excluding food 
    and energy posted its largest rise since January. At the same time, 
    prices of intermediate materials declined a bit further in November. 
    According to recent survey results, consumers now expected less 
    inflation over the year ahead and also over the next five to ten 
    years. The available data on wages and worker benefits continued on 
    balance to display a relatively subdued trend of increases in labor 
    compensation.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on November 15, 1995, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the 
    likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting 
    period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's 
    long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic 
    growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and 
    monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly 
    lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting 
    period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were 
    expected to be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
    coming months.

[SECTION]

Open market operations were directed toward maintaining the 
    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the 
    intermeeting period. The federal funds rate averaged a bit above the 
    expected rate of 5-3/4 percent over the period. The bunching of 
    settlements of several Treasury issues that had resulted from debt 
    ceiling disruptions and the mid-December corporate tax date were among 
    the factors exerting pressure on the funds rate. Most other short-term interest rates fell slightly and longer-term interest rates 
    extended earlier declines during the intermeeting period. Market 
    expectations of some easing of monetary policy appeared to be 
    reinforced by market interpretations of the incoming information as 
    further evidence that overall demand would be restrained and that the 
    risks of a pickup in inflationary pressures had diminished. Over the 
    intermeeting interval, major indexes of stock prices continued to move 
    higher in concert with the rise in bond prices.

[SECTION]

The sluggish performance of the broad monetary aggregates 
    since August continued in November. Despite the persistence of low 
    opportunity costs associated with holding M2 assets, M2 growth was 
    relatively modest in November after a slight contraction in October. 
    M3 growth slowed further in November, partly as a result of a shift of 
    funding by borrowers toward capital market instruments to take 
    advantage of lower long-term market rates. Nonetheless, because of 
    robust expansion earlier in the year, M2 remained in the upper half of 
    its 1995 range through November and M3 expanded at a rate at the upper 
    end of its range. Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had 
    slowed somewhat in recent months, reflecting reduced expansion of both 
    private and federal borrowing, and for 1995 to date, this debt measure 
    had grown at a rate around the midpoint of its monitoring range.

[SECTION]

In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies rose slightly further on 
    balance over the intermeeting period. Declining interest rates in 
    several major foreign industrial countries, evidently induced by 
    disappointing economic growth in those countries, appeared to have a 
    firming effect on the dollar in relation to European currencies. The 
    dollar changed little against the Japanese yen over the period after a 
    sharp advance earlier. The Mexican peso appreciated a bit in relation 
    to the dollar over the period.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
    the growth of economic activity would slow substantially from the very 
    strong pace now indicated for the third quarter. Although this 
    forecast did not differ significantly from that prepared for the 
    November meeting, less growth than expected earlier seemed likely in 
    the current quarter. Over the forecast horizon, however, the economy 
    was still projected to expand at a pace that would keep activity close 
    to the economy's potential. The forecast anticipated that the 
    expansion in consumer spending would slow a bit in response to 
    diminished gains in disposable income associated with less-rapid 
    advances in spending in other sectors of the economy. The rise that 
    had occurred in the value of financial assets held by households would 
    be a positive factor helping to support consumer spending but one that 
    would be offset to a degree by the difficulties of an increasing 
    number of households in servicing their growing debts. The greater 
    affordability of housing stemming from the earlier decline in mortgage 
    rates was projected to help sustain homebuilding activity at a 
    relatively high level. In the context of reduced growth in sales and 
    profits, business investment in new equipment and structures was 
    projected to increase more moderately after several years of rapid 
    advance. Although indications of excess inventories were limited, 
    slower growth in sales and ongoing efforts to reduce inventory costs 
    were projected to lead to smaller increases in stocks over the 
    projection period. Exports were expected to be bolstered to some 
    extent by the projected improvement in the economies of major trading 
    partners. Although a great deal of uncertainty still surrounded the 
    fiscal outlook, the forecast continued to incorporate an appreciable 
    degree of fiscal restraint. Given the projected outlook, rates of 
    utilization of labor and capital resources would remain relatively 
    high, and the underlying trend of price inflation was seen as unlikely 
    to change significantly over the projection period.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    developments, members noted that the information that had become 
    available since the November meeting tended to confirm earlier 
    indications that the economic expansion had slowed appreciably from 
    the brisk pace of the summer months. The members generally agreed 
    that the most likely course for the economy remained one of moderate 
    growth. Expansion at or near potential was seen as the most probable 
    outcome, associated at least in part with the favorable effects on 
    business and consumer spending of lower interest rates, higher equity 
    prices, and an ample availability of credit. However, a number of 
    members expressed concern that the strength of final demands would not 
    be sufficient to support growth near the economy's potential, absent a 
    policy adjustment. One factor that might retard growth was a higher 
    level of real short-term interest rates owing to the favorable 
    performance of inflation. Members noted that consumer price increases 
    had remained relatively subdued and below expectations in recent 
    months, despite the generally high levels of utilization of both labor 
    and capital resources that had prevailed through much of the year. 
    Several commented that the effects of new technologies, gains in 
    productivity, global competitive pressures on businesses, and 
    restraint in wage setting might imply that inflation would edge down 
    further. Others expressed concern that the prospects for further 
    reductions in inflation seemed quite limited in the context of 
    projected high levels of resource use, including tight labor markets 
    in many parts of the country.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of regional developments, 
    members reported that anecdotal and other information pertaining to 
    regional activity suggested that the moderation in nationwide economic 
    growth was evident across most of the nation, with the rate of 
    expansion ranging from slow to moderate in different areas of the 
    country. Overall levels of business activity continued to vary 
    widely, from relatively weak in some areas to comparatively robust in 
    others. Conditions also were uneven across industries, particularly 
    in manufacturing, where flagging auto sales and some further inventory 
    accumulation contrasted sharply with brisk demand for a range of 
    producers durable goods, notably office and computing equipment, and 
    building products. Despite indications that job growth had been 
    relatively limited, labor markets remained tight in many parts of the 
    country and there were more, albeit still limited, reports of rising 
    wage pressures; in some areas, however, labor market conditions 
    appeared to have eased somewhat recently.

[SECTION]

In their discussion of developments in key sectors of the 
    economy, members commented that the data and the anecdotal information 
    on consumer spending had been mixed. For the holiday season, reports 
    indicated that retail sales had been disappointing thus far, though 
    sales appeared to be holding up relatively well in some sections of 
    the country and for higher-priced luxury items more generally. 
    Consumers had remained very cautious despite considerable promotional 
    sales activity, perhaps anticipating even more aggressive markdowns of 
    prices as the shopping season neared its end. Members noted that the 
    reluctance of consumers also might be reflecting a sense of continued 
    job insecurity in an environment of ongoing business restructuring and 
    downsizing, higher debt service burdens and rising delinquency rates, 
    and the satisfaction of pent-up demand for durable goods. While these 
    factors might be exerting an inhibiting influence on consumers, the 
    members generally viewed moderate growth in consumer spending as a 
    reasonable expectation in the context of further projected expansion 
    in disposable incomes. The increase in household wealth associated 
    with the strong performance of the bond and stock markets might tend 
    to boost consumer spending relative to disposable incomes, although 
    one member suggested that the highly concentrated nature of wealth 
    holdings might limit any positive effect on aggregate consumption. 
    With regard to housing, members took note of the recent declines in 
    single-family housing starts and sales after a strong third quarter. 
    They remarked, however, that some of their contacts were anticipating 
    that the declines in mortgage interest rates over recent months to 
    their current relatively low levels would foster a wave of mortgage 
    refinancing and a pickup in housing demand in the spring.

[SECTION]

Business fixed investment was expected to grow at a pace 
    appreciably less than that observed in recent years but nonetheless to 
    continue supplying considerable impetus to the expansion. Strong 
    profits and cash flows, along with the ample availability of financing 
    on attractive terms, were favorable factors in the outlook; on the 
    other hand, a weakening trend in final demand, notably in consumer 
    outlays, likely would have a negative effect on business capital 
    spending. Several members reported that commercial and other 
    nonresidential construction activity remained brisk in various regions 
    around the nation. A number of members commented on business 
    inventory developments. Overall inventories of motor vehicles were on 
    the high side, and inventory accumulation more generally appeared to 
    be running somewhat ahead of sales. There were no indications that 
    serious overhangs were emerging, but there were risks that efforts to 
    hold down stocks would damp production over the near term.

[SECTION]

The outlook for fiscal policy continued to be clouded by the 
    uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the debate between the Congress 
    and the Administration. The members anticipated that the result of 
    the debate would be considerable fiscal restraint, but the timing of 
    tax and spending initiatives aimed at an eventual balancing of the 
    budget and the extent of the fiscal contraction over time could not be 
    forecast with any precision. In the interim, much of the federal 
    government was closed, and while federal workers were expected to 
    get paid eventually, their spending and that of federal contractors 
    might be damped until the situation was resolved. The members 
    believed, however, that in light of the plans being put forward, the 
    fiscal drag imposed by likely federal budget developments would not be 
    unusually large over the next few years.

[SECTION]

In reviewing the outlook for inflation, members referred to 
    the generally favorable price and cost experience of recent months. 
    Several pointed to subdued increases in labor compensation and to 
    anecdotal indications that upward pressures on wages and benefits 
    remained scattered despite tightness in many labor markets. In this 
    environment, and with the economy expected to expand at a 
    comparatively moderate pace over the forecast period, many members 
    anticipated that inflation would remain relatively stable despite 
    continuing high levels of resource utilization, and some believed that 
    it might record a somewhat improved performance. One argument 
    advanced in support of a possibly better performance was that the 
    recent experience, which had been more favorable than expected given 
    capacity utilization levels, was perhaps suggestive of the effects of 
    rapid technological improvements on productivity, the enhanced 
    efficiencies from greater economic specialization around the world, 
    and the influence of heightened job insecurity on wages and prices. 
    Another was the possible effect on future wage demands of the lower 
    inflation expectations that now prevailed. Although no member saw 
    greater inflation as having a high probability, several did refer to 
    risks in that direction, including the possibility of greater 
    pressures on resources stemming from faster than currently anticipated 
    economic growth.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, all the members either favored or could accept a slight 
    easing in the degree of pressure on reserve positions. One argument 
    cited in favor of some easing was that the policy stance, as indexed 
    by the prevailing real federal funds rate, was becoming somewhat 
    restrictive as inflation and inflationary expectations moderated, 
    leaving real short-term rates higher than anticipated. In addition, 
    with markets expecting a reduction in the federal funds rate in coming 
    months, an unchanged policy was likely to lead to a backup in 
    intermediate- and long-term rates. Although there was no sign that a 
    cumulative deterioration in economic performance was about to get 
    under way, the downside risks to the expansion appeared to have 
    increased and a modest easing would better position policy to guard 
    against the possibility that over the longer term the expansion would 
    begin to fall short of the economy's potential, especially with fiscal 
    policy likely to be at least moderately restrictive. In any case, the 
    recent slowing of the economic expansion, combined with the wage and 
    price restraint evident at current levels of resource utilization and 
    continuing business efforts to expand capacity, suggested that there 
    was little risk of a pickup in inflation. Indeed, the favorable 
    inflation experience over the last half year raised the possibility of 
    continued modest price improvement.

[SECTION]

A number of members, though willing to accept a slight 
    easing, preferred an unchanged policy stance. While inflation had 
    slowed from the elevated pace observed in the early part of the year, 
    there was little hard evidence to indicate that it would decline any 
    further over the forecast horizon or that there had been a significant 
    increase in the sustainable growth rate of the economy. A few members 
    also expressed concern about the possible repercussions in financial 
    markets of an easing action that would follow an already strong rally 
    in bond and stock prices. In the circumstances, these members 
    questioned whether a somewhat easier policy stance would prove 
    consistent with the Committee's objective of fostering further 
    progress toward price stability. Moreover, although the available 
    evidence on the economy's current performance remained mixed, the 
    moderation in economic growth after the third-quarter surge did not 
    seem at this time to signal a growing shortfall of the economy from 
    its potential. Instead, the economy was likely in this view to 
    continue to grow at a generally acceptable rate at or near capacity, 
    and a few members saw some potential for somewhat faster growth at a 
    pace that over time could intensify inflationary pressures. 
    Accordingly, they preferred to wait for further evidence on inflation 
    trends and the performance of the economy, but they indicated that in 
    light of the uncertainties that were involved and the small amount of 
    easing that was proposed they would not dissent from the majority 
    position.

[SECTION]

With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the 
    intermeeting period, all the members endorsed a proposal to retain an 
    intermeeting instruction in the directive that did not incorporate any 
    presumption about the direction of a possible intermeeting change. 
    While such a change in policy could not be ruled out, the potential 
    need for a further intermeeting policy adjustment appeared remote at 
    this juncture. The risks to the outlook seemed generally in balance, 
    and the direction of the next policy move was not clear in the view of 
    some members.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members indicated that they favored or could support a directive that 
    called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure on reserve 
    conditions during the intermeeting period but that contained no 
    presumption about the likely direction of any intermeeting policy 
    change. Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run 
    objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
    giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary 
    developments, the Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly 
    lesser monetary restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting 
    period. A staff analysis indicated that the reserve conditions 
    contemplated at this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth 
    of M2 and M3 over coming months.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and 
    directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute 
    transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following 
    domestic policy directive:

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      a substantial slowing in the expansion of economic 
      activity after a strong gain in the third quarter. 
      Nonfarm payroll employment increased further in 
      November, but the civilian unemployment rate edged up 
      to 5.6 percent. Industrial production was little 
      changed on average over October and November after a 
      moderate rise in the third quarter. Total nominal 
      retail sales rose somewhat on balance over October and 
      November. Housing starts were down in October after a 
      large increase in the third quarter. However, orders 
      for nondefense capital goods point to substantial 
      expansion of spending on business equipment in the near 
      term, and nonresidential construction has risen 
      appreciably further. Wage trends have been stable and 
      consumer prices have risen relatively slowly on average 
      in recent months.

[SECTION]

Most market interest rates have declined slightly 
      since the Committee meeting on November 15. In foreign 
      exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
      dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies has risen 
      slightly on balance over the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

The substantial moderation in the growth of M2 and 
      M3 since midsummer continued in November; however, for 
      the year through November, M2 expanded at a rate in the 
      upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate 
      at the upper end of its range. Growth in total 
      domestic nonfinancial debt has slowed somewhat in 
      recent months but for the year to date remains around 
      the midpoint of its monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July reaffirmed the range it had established 
      on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 
      percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also 
      retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year that it had set for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range 
      for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to 
      take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 
      1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis 
      the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary 
      aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of 
      the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
      in the light of progress toward price level stability, 
      movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
      economy and financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the 
      existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In 
      the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint would be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.
