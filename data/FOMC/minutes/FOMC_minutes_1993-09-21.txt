    the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
    in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, September 21, 1993, at 9:00 a.m.

Ms. Betsy B. White, Vice President for Domestic Operations of

    August 17, 1993,  through September 20, 1993. By unanimous vote, the 
    Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
    financial outlook and the formulation of monetary policy for the 
    intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
    information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed by the Committee at this meeting 
    suggested that economic activity, adjusted for the temporary 
    depressing effects of the flood in the Midwest, was continuing to 
    expand at a moderate pace. Consumer spending was up, and business 
    purchases of durable equipment had recorded further healthy gains. On 
    the other hand, housing activity had shown a muted response to the 
    declines in mortgage rates that had occurred through the spring, and 
    gains in manufacturing output and in employment had been limited in 
    recent months. After rising at an accelerated rate in the early part 
    of the year, consumer prices had increased more slowly in recent 
    months and producer prices had fallen.

[SECTION]

Total nonfarm payroll employment edged lower in August after 
    a sizable gain in July. Hiring in the service-producing sectors, 
    especially in health and business services, was down in August from 
    the pace of recent months, and more jobs were lost in manufacturing. 
    Construction employment also moved lower, retracing part of the July 
    increase. On the other hand, the average workweek rose to a 
    relatively high level in August, and as a result, aggregate hours 
    worked by production or nonsupervisory workers were significantly 
    above the second-quarter average. The civilian unemployment rate 
    declined to 6.7 percent.

[SECTION]

Industrial production posted a further moderate gain in 
    August. Manufacturing output more than accounted for the increase, as 
    strikes damped mining production and utilities output was unchanged 
    following large gains in earlier months. Within manufacturing, the 
    output of motor vehicles and parts was unchanged. Excluding the motor 
    vehicle component, another sharp gain in computers and related 
    electronic components boosted the production of business equipment, 
    while the output of consumer goods declined as a result of a 
    retrenchment in appliance production following the advance posted in 
    July. Total utilization of manufacturing capacity edged up again in 
    August.

[SECTION]

Total retail sales were little changed in real terms in July 
    and August. Despite the recent sluggishness, however, real spending 
    for goods in July and August was appreciably above the level in the 
    second quarter. In addition, real expenditures for services had grown 
    rapidly in July; this reflected both high energy consumption 
    associated with unusually hot weather and robust spending for other 
    services. The persistence of hot weather through August suggested 
    that spending on energy services continued at a high level for that 
    month. After a slight decline in July, housing starts rose 
    substantially in August. Single-family starts accounted for all of 
    the August increase, as multifamily starts fell further and continued 
    to hover around their thirty-year low.

[SECTION]

Growth in real business fixed investment appeared to be 
    slowing in the third quarter from the robust pace earlier in the year. 
    Shipments of nondefense capital goods dropped substantially in July, 
    with all of the decline occurring in the volatile aircraft component. 
    For capital goods other than aircraft and parts, shipments again moved 
    higher in July; while the demand for computing equipment strengthened 
    after dropping off somewhat in the second quarter, shipments of other 
    types of durable equipment softened. In addition, heavy-truck sales 
    were off substantially in July after advancing steadily since late 
    1992, and fleet sales of light vehicles were down in July and August. 
    Investment in nonresidential structures posted its largest advance in 
    three years in the second quarter. However, construction activity 
    fell in July in reflection of a sharp decline in the construction of 
    commercial structures other than offices.

[SECTION]

Business inventories contracted sharply in July after 
    changing little in June. The bulk of the July decline occurred in the 
    retail sector and reflected drawdowns in inventories at automobile 
    dealerships. Non-auto retail inventories edged down in July; with 
    sales flat, the ratio of non-auto inventories to sales remained near 
    the high end of the range for the past several years. In the 
    wholesale trade sector, stocks were trimmed somewhat further in July, 
    but the inventory-to-sales ratio remained at the midpoint of its range 
    over the past three years. Manufacturing stocks were unchanged in 
    July after a small reduction in June. With shipments down in July 
    owing to weak shipments of aircraft and motor vehicles, the stocks-to-sales ratio rebounded in July but was still at a low level.

[SECTION]

The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit decreased in July, 
    but it remained essentially unchanged from its average rate in the 
    second quarter. The value of exports edged lower in July, while the 
    value of imports fell by more, retracing nearly all of the sizable 
    June rise. The decline in imports was primarily in automotive 
    products, consumer goods, and oil. The performance of the major 
    foreign industrial economies continued to present a mixed picture. 
    Economic activity in Japan, after increasing slightly in the first 
    quarter, evidenced renewed weakness in the second quarter that 
    apparently persisted into the third quarter. In western Germany, real 
    output rose in the second quarter, but much of the gain apparently 
    stemmed from unintended inventory accumulation. In France and Italy, 
    economic activity appeared to have leveled out in the second quarter 
    after declining earlier. By contrast, both the United Kingdom and 
    Canada recorded further modest gains in economic activity.

[SECTION]

Producer prices of finished goods fell sharply further in 
    August; higher prices for consumer foods were more than offset by 
    lower prices for the energy and the nonfood, non-energy components of 
    the index. For finished goods other than food and energy, producer 
    prices increased over the twelve months ended in August by a 
    considerably smaller amount than in the previous twelve-month period. 
    Consumer prices rose a little faster in August than in July, with an 
    increase in food prices counterbalancing a decline in prices of 
    consumer energy goods. For nonfood, non-energy items, consumer prices 
    advanced over the twelve months ended in August by an amount 
    comparable to that recorded for the twelve months ended in August 
    1992. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers 
    were up in August after little change on balance in June and July; the 
    rise reflected in part overtime earnings in manufacturing. Over the 
    twelve months ended in August, this measure of earnings increased by 
    about the same amount as in the previous twelve-month period.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on August 17, 1993, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that, in contrast to the two previous 
    directives, did not include a tilt toward possible firming of reserve 
    conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive 
    indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives 
    for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving 
    careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary 
    developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser 
    reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. 
    The reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to 
    be consistent with modest growth of M2 and little net change in M3 
    over the balance of the third quarter.

[SECTION]

Open market operations were directed during the intermeeting 
    period toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions. The federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent over 
    the period, while adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat 
    above anticipated levels, reflecting demand for adjustment credit by 
    banks experiencing temporary technical difficulties.

[SECTION]

Other short-term interest rates were little changed on 
    balance over the intermeeting period, while yields on intermediate- 
    and long-term debt obligations declined somewhat. The drop in longer-term yields appeared to be associated with incoming data indicating 
    continuing sluggishness in economic activity and the more favorable 
    performance of broad measures of prices. Major indexes of stock 
    prices increased somewhat further over the intermeeting period, 
    evidently reflecting lower bond yields and heavy inflows to stock 
    mutual funds.

[SECTION]

In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies depreciated on balance 
    over the intermeeting period. Much of the dollar's decline reflected 
    the strength of the mark and other European currencies, which was 
    related in part to the unexpectedly slow pace of monetary easing in 
    Germany and other European countries. Against the yen, the dollar 
    rebounded early in the intermeeting period from the historical low 
    that occurred around the time of the Committee's August meeting. The 
    dollar was buoyed by joint central bank sales of yen against the 
    dollar and by the accompanying public statement from the U.S. Treasury 
    that was seen by market participants as signaling a new attitude 
    toward any further appreciation of the yen. On September 21, the 
    dollar rose sharply on news that President Yeltsin had dissolved the 
    Russian Parliament.

[SECTION]

Growth of M2 continued at a slow rate in August. The 
    sluggishness in this aggregate, which occurred despite further rapid 
    expansion in its Ml component, apparently reflected ongoing efforts by 
    households to shift funds away from depository accounts in search of 
    better returns. M3 turned up after declining in June and July; 
    however, expansion of this aggregate continued to be held down by 
    declines in institution-only money market funds. For the year through 
    August, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates close to the 
    lower ends of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately in recent months, and for 
    the year through July it was estimated to have increased at a rate in 
    the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested 
    moderate growth in economic activity and limited reductions in margins 
    of unemployed labor and capital through next year. Fiscal restraint, 
    uncertainty about other government policies, and slow growth of 
    foreign industrial economies over the near term would act as a 
    constraint on the economy. However, improving balance-sheet positions 
    and credit supply conditions were lifting an unusual constraint on 
    spending, and the lower interest rates would encourage further 
    increases in consumer spending, housing construction, and business 
    fixed investment. The continued slack in labor and product markets, 
    coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to 
    foster further reductions in wage and price inflation.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    economic conditions, members commented that recent developments had 
    not altered their outlook for moderate and sustained expansion in 
    economic activity. The members acknowledged that the interpretation 
    of ongoing developments presented some unusual problems, notably the 
    difficulty of reconciling the appreciable growth in employment thus 
    far this year with the slow expansion in measured output: the 
    associated drop in measured productivity was especially surprising in 
    light of the business drive toward more efficient operations. 
    Moreover, the economic outlook clearly remained subject to a variety 
    of uncertainties, including potential developments abroad that were 
    especially difficult to predict. Nonetheless, while temporary factors 
    were likely to depress third-quarter expansion, the members saw little 
    in the current statistical or anecdotal reports on the domestic 
    economy that pointed to the likelihood of a significant deviation from 
    a moderate growth trend. It was noted in this connection that the 
    inhibiting effects of increased fiscal restraint and expected further 
    weakness in net exports needed to be weighed against the favorable 
    effects on interest-sensitive spending of considerably reduced 
    intermediate- and long-term interest rates and the much improved 
    financial condition of many business firms and households. With 
    regard to the outlook for inflation, some members suggested that the 
    prospects for continued slack in resource utilization were consistent 
    with a disinflationary trend, but the disparate factors bearing on the 
    outlook for inflation as well as the swings in price performance 
    experienced in recent quarters argued for caution in assessing the 
    future course of inflation.

[SECTION]

In their review of developments around the nation, members 
    commented that business conditions remained uneven across local areas 
    and industries, but they characterized general economic activity in 
    most regions as ranging from little change to moderate growth since 
    mid-summer. However, business conditions continued to be quite weak 
    in some areas, notably in California, and business sentiment appeared 
    to have remained cautious in much of the nation. One member 
    emphasized uneven conditions of a different kind. Relatively 
    disadvantaged members of the population, often living in inner cities, 
    had high and rising expectations about their economic prospects. At 
    the same time, however, some traditional paths of upward mobility were 
    being cut back, such as the military and civil service within the 
    government and office jobs more generally. In addition, regulations 
    aimed at correcting some problems in financial institutions--such as 
    real estate appraisal and downpayment requirements--were having 
    unintended adverse effects on lower-income businesses and households, 
    and other proposals aimed at promoting minority lending were in danger 
    of promising more than they could deliver. An apparently widening gap 
    between economic realities and aspirations might not have measurable 
    implications for the macroeconomic outlook over short periods of time, 
    but they reflected a worrisome trend in terms of the longer-run health 
    of the economy.

[SECTION]

In other comments, members referred to a number of financial 
    developments that had favorable implications for sustained economic 
    expansion. Business firms and consumers had made substantial progress 
    in strengthening their balance sheets, and while the process of 
    adjusting balance sheets evidently was still under way, the material 
    improvement accomplished thus far had diminished financial risks and 
    constraints on spending. Banking institutions had bolstered their 
    capital positions and were in a better position to accommodate 
    increases in loan demand. Bond and stock markets had exhibited 
    considerable strength. In this connection, however, a few members 
    commented on the apparently growing concern in financial markets that 
    current equity prices were high relative to earnings and dividends. 
    A correction in U.S. equity markets could trigger cumulative selling, 
    especially by mutual funds, which had garnered substantial new 
    investors, some of whom might not fully appreciate the risks of their 
    new assets relative to deposits. On the positive side, there were 
    good reasons for optimism on the trajectory of business profits in an 
    environment of low inflation and moderate growth. Moreover, some 
    managers of mutual funds reportedly were taking steps to strengthen 
    the liquidity of their portfolios, and members reported on efforts to 
    improve individual investor awareness of the risks of equity 
    investments.

[SECTION]

During their review of the prospective performance of key 
    sectors of the economy, members gave somewhat mixed reports on retail 
    sales in recent weeks, but they generally anticipated that consumer 
    spending would provide continued if not strong support to sustained 
    economic expansion. As had been true for an extended period, consumer 
    attitudes remained hesitant in the context of concerns about 
    employment and income prospects and, in the case of many consumers 
    with higher incomes, increased income tax liabilities. Some members 
    expressed the view that more vigorous growth in employment might well 
    occur as the expansion matured, and such a development would be likely 
    to have a favorable effect on consumer attitudes and spending.

[SECTION]

Cautious attitudes also appeared to have held back housing 
    demand and construction activity despite declines in mortgage interest 
    rates. The combination of some further declines in mortgage interest 
    rates recently and a tendency for house prices to stabilize or even to 
    firm in some markets seemed to have induced appreciable and widespread 
    strengthening in demand for single-family housing. Indeed, despite 
    persisting weakness in some areas, housing markets were described as 
    quite strong in many parts of the country, and the overall improvement 
    in housing activity might not be captured in the latest statistics. 
    Other construction activity appeared on the whole to have bottomed out 
    and might have begun to trend higher. Anecdotal reports suggested a 
    pickup in the volume of commercial property transactions, though 
    apparently not yet in the prices of commercial properties in most 
    areas, and rising construction outlays were anticipated for 
    commercial, industrial, and institutional facilities as economic 
    activity continued to expand. Office construction was likely to 
    remain generally depressed as excess capacity continued to be 
    absorbed, but such construction might not decline further. Members 
    also anticipated appreciable further growth in business spending for 
    equipment, notably for the purpose of enhancing productivity in an 
    environment of strong competitive pressures; concurrently, spending to 
    expand capacity seemed likely to remain relatively limited unless 
    consumer spending gathered more momentum in coming quarters than was 
    now anticipated. On balance, business fixed investment was expected 
    to continue to provide considerable support to the economic expansion.

[SECTION]

The passage of deficit-reduction legislation in July implied 
    increased fiscal restraint but also appeared to have improved 
    confidence in financial markets and in the business community more 
    generally regarding the ability of the federal government to enact 
    needed legislation. At the same time,  the new taxes stemming from 
    that legislation and a greater focus on the potential for further 
    legislation, notably health care reform and its implications for 
    mandated business costs, were a key factor in sustaining cautious 
    attitudes among business executives. Members also referred to the 
    constraining effects in many areas, and on the economy more generally, 
    of current and prospective cutbacks in defense expenditures, spending 
    curbs by state and local governments, and the outlook for further tax 
    increases by many of these governments.

[SECTION]

The prospects for net exports also were cited as a negative 
    factor in the economic outlook. Expectations of persisting weakness 
    in some major foreign economies implied relatively limited growth in 
    U.S. exports in a period when moderate expansion in this country was 
    likely to foster somewhat more rapid increases in U.S. imports. 
    Some members also commented that the controversial NAFTA legislation 
    under consideration in the Congress continued to dominate business 
    discussions in parts of the country. It was suggested that whatever 
    its eventual benefits for the three nations immediately involved might 
    be, a defeat of that legislation could prove to be a setback for the 
    GATT negotiations with dislocative implications for world trade.

[SECTION]

Many members referred to the more favorable price developments that had occurred since the early part of the year when key 
    measures of inflation had surged. While it was premature to conclude 
    that a distinct disinflationary trend had been re-established, the 
    members generally agreed that price pressures were likely to remain 
    subdued given their projections of some continuing slack in resource 
    utilization. Favorable developments tending to support that 
    conclusion included the persistence of intensely competitive 
    conditions in most markets for goods around the country. The costs of 
    materials purchased by business firms generally were reported to be 
    rising only slowly, if at all. There were indications of fairly tight 
    labor markets in some areas, but wage pressures remained limited even 
    in those markets. At the same time, the costs of worker benefits 
    continued to rise fairly rapidly and many business contacts were 
    expressing concern about the possibility of further mandated cost 
    increases related to the health care reform legislation. For the next 
    several months, relatively rapid increases in food prices associated 
    with weather-related crop losses and an increase in the excise tax on 
    gasoline would tend to boost consumer prices. On balance, these 
    developments were not seen as inconsistent with longer-run progress 
    toward price stability, though the inflation outlook remained subject 
    to considerable uncertainty.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, all of the members agreed that recent economic and 
    financial developments pointed to the desirability of an unchanged 
    policy stance. The members recognized that neither the pace of the 
    economic expansion nor the uncertain progress toward price stability 
    reflected a wholly satisfactory economic performance, but at this 
    point the present posture of monetary policy continued to offer the 
    best promise in their view of promoting sustained economic growth in 
    the context of subdued if not declining inflation.

[SECTION]

From the perspective of a variety of financial measures, the 
    current monetary policy continued quite accommodative. Short-term 
    interest rates were low, indeed close to zero after adjustment for 
    inflation, and there had been appreciable further declines in longer-term interest rates. Growth of M2 remained slow, but it had picked up 
    since earlier in the year, and M3 had expanded in August, albeit at a 
    sluggish rate, after declining in previous months. One member 
    observed that growth in M2, adjusted to include certain stock and bond 
    mutual funds, was estimated to have accelerated since early spring to 
    a fairly healthy pace. Narrow measures of money and reserves, though 
    subject to a variety of influences, were growing at rates that 
    suggested an ample provision of liquidity to the economy.

[SECTION]

In considering possible adjustments to policy during the 
    intermeeting period, all of the members endorsed a proposal to retain 
    a symmetrical directive. While current economic uncertainties were 
    mirrored in uncertainties about the future course of monetary policy, the members agreed that developments in the period until the next 
    meeting in mid-November were not likely to call for any adjustment to 
    policy. Beyond the nearer term, however, both the timing and, in the 
    view of at least some members, the direction of the next policy change 
    could not be foreseen at this time. While they did not see convincing 
    evidence that monetary policy was overly stimulative at this point, 
    some members were concerned the current stance, as reflected in short-term interest rates, was quite accommodative and probably would need 
    to be firmed at some point. These members stressed the need to remain 
    especially alert to potential inflationary developments against the 
    background of persisting inflationary expectations and uncertain 
    progress toward price stability. Other members, while sharing this 
    concern to an extent, gave some weight to the possibility that the 
    expansion might remain quite sluggish for a period; under the 
    circumstances, they foresaw the need to maintain an accommodative 
    policy posture and could not rule out the possibility that the next 
    policy move might have to be toward greater monetary stimulus.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members indicated their support of a directive that called for 
    maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and 
    that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any 
    adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in 
    the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
    and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided 
    that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
    acceptable during the intermeeting period. According to a staff 
    analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were 
    expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over the 
    balance of the year.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
    New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that economic activity is continuing to expand at a 
      moderate pace. Total nonfarm payroll employment edged 
      down in August after a sizable gain in July, but the 
      average workweek rose to a relatively high level and 
      the civilian unemployment rate declined to 6.7 percent. 
      Industrial production has advanced moderately over 
      recent months. Retail sales changed little in real 
      terms in July and August after increasing appreciably 
      in the second quarter. Housing starts were down 
      slightly in July but rose substantially in August. 
      Available indicators suggest a slowing in the expansion 
      of business capital spending from a robust pace earlier 
      in the year. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade 
      deficit was about unchanged in July from its average 
      rate in the second quarter. After rising at an 
      accelerated rate in the early part of the year, 
      consumer prices have increased more slowly and producer 
      prices have fallen in recent months.

Short-term interest rates have changed little 
      since the Committee meeting on August 17, while yields 
      on intermediate and long-term debt obligations have 
      declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, the 
      trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the 
      other G-10 currencies depreciated substantially over 
      the intermeeting period.

M2 continued to expand at a slow rate in August, 
      while M3 turned up after declining in June and July. 
      For the year through August, M2 and M3 are estimated 
      to have grown at rates close to the lower end of the 
      Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in 
      recent months, and for the year through July it is 
      estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half 
      of the Committee's monitoring range.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established 
      in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 
      percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
      the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
      1993. The Committee anticipated that developments 
      contributing to unusual velocity increases would 
      persist over the balance of the year and that money 
      growth within these lower ranges would be consistent 
      with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range 
      for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was 
      lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the 
      Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary 
      growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
      fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 
      0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set 
      the monitoring range for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The 
      behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be 
      evaluated in the light of progress toward price level 
      stability, movements in their velocities, and 
      developments in the economy and financial markets.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent 
      with modest growth in M2 and M3 over the balance of the 
      year.

During the intermeeting period, available members 
    participated in three telephone conference calls to discuss issues 
    relating to the release of information about discussions at Federal 
    Open Market Committee meetings. These calls were prompted by hearings 
    on such issues that were held by the House Committee on Banking, 
    Finance, and Urban Affairs. The discussions took into account 
    information that unedited transcripts for meetings since early 1976 
    were maintained by the FOMC secretariat at the Board of Governors. 
    The members did not reach any decisions on these matters during these 
    conferences. In the course of two further telephone conferences 
    during the intermeeting period, the Committee reviewed economic and 
    financial developments affecting Mexico and discussed various 
    contingencies that might involve the Federal Reserve.
