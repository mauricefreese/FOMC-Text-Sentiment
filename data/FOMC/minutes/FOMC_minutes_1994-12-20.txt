By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal 
  Open Market Committee held on November 15, 1994, were approved.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the Committee elected Mark S. Sniderman as 
  Associate Economist from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to 
  serve until the next election at the first meeting of the Committee 
  after December 31, 1994, with the understanding that in the event he 
  discontinued his official connection with the Federal Reserve Bank of 
  Cleveland, he would cease to have any official connection with the 
  Federal Open Market Committee.

[SECTION]

The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments 
  in foreign exchange markets since the November meeting. There were no 
  System open market transactions in foreign currencies during this 
  period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.

[SECTION]

The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments 
  in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions 
  in government securities and federal agency obligations during the 
  period November 15, 1994, through December 19, 1994. By unanimous 
  vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
  financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the 
  intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
  information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
  Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
  policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested a further 
  pickup in economic growth in recent months. Consumer spending, 
  supported by strong expansion of employment and income and by buoyant 
  consumer sentiment, remained robust. Business capital spending and 
  exports were rising briskly. Payroll employment remained on a strong 
  upward trend, and industrial output posted further substantial gains. 
  Broad indexes of prices of consumer goods and services increased 
  moderately on average over recent months, although prices of many 
  industrial materials and intermediate supplies continued to move up 
  rapidly.

[SECTION]

Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November after an 
  appreciable expansion in October. Job gains in the service-producing 
  sector were stronger in November than in October, as a pickup in 
  hiring in business services more than offset slower growth in health 
  services and retail trade. Employment in manufacturing recorded 
  another sizable advance in November, with increases widespread by 
  industry. Hiring in construction was up considerably in November 
  after a small gain in October. Job growth outpaced the expansion of 
  the labor force in November, and the civilian unemployment rate 
  declined to 5.6 percent.

[SECTION]

Industrial production, led by further increases in 
  manufacturing output, registered another large gain in November. 
  Among major market groups, production of business equipment surged and 
  sizable increases were recorded for the output of materials and 
  construction supplies. With the growth of production outpacing the 
  expansion of capacity in November, the rate of utilization of total 
  industrial capacity moved up further from an already high level.

[SECTION]

Retail sales continued to rise rapidly in November. Sales 
  were up solidly at most types of stores, but gains were particularly 
  large at durable goods outlets. Consumer spending on services also 
  had grown significantly in October (latest data), with advances 
  widespread among categories of services. Housing starts increased 
  appreciably in November, when construction activity apparently was 
  boosted by favorable weather in some parts of the country. 
  Multifamily starts rose in November to their highest level in four 
  years, while single-family starts retraced a large part of their 
  October decline.

[SECTION]

Business capital spending remained on a pronounced upward 
  trend. Shipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft were 
  up slightly further in October after having advanced sharply in the 
  two previous months; shipments of computing equipment were brisk in 
  October, while shipments of other capital goods were little changed. 
  With regard to transportation equipment, outlays for aircraft 
  continued to trend lower in October, while sales of heavy trucks rose 
  appreciably. Recent data on orders for nondefense capital goods 
  pointed to continued vigorous expansion of spending on business 
  equipment. Nonresidential construction activity advanced further in 
  October, led by higher spending for institutional and public utility 
  structures. The uptrend in permits suggested further advances in 
  nonresidential construction.

[SECTION]

Business inventory investment was relatively robust in 
  October. Manufacturing inventories rebounded after a small decline in 
  September; a sizable amount of the October increase occurred at firms 
  producing computers, office machinery, and telecommunications 
  equipment for which demand had been strong. For manufacturing as a 
  whole, the stocks-to-shipments ratio remained near a historically low 
  level. Wholesale inventories continued to climb at a pace in line 
  with sales, and the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector stayed 
  near the middle of its range over recent years. Retail inventory 
  accumulation slowed substantially in October; much of the slowdown 
  reflected a sharp drop in stocks at automotive dealerships. With 
  sales up sharply, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector 
  fell in October and remained near the middle of its range over recent 
  years.

[SECTION]

The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
  widened somewhat in October from its September level and from its 
  average rate for the third quarter. The increase in the deficit from 
  September's level reflected a small decline in the value of exports of 
  goods and services, which resulted primarily from reduced aircraft 
  shipments, and a small rise in the value of imports. Economic 
  activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to expand 
  rapidly in the third quarter, and available indicators generally 
  suggested further substantial gains in the fourth quarter.

[SECTION]

Despite further sizable increases in the prices of many goods 
  at the early stages of processing, inflation at the consumer level 
  remained moderate in October and November. Energy prices were 
  unchanged on balance over the two months, while food prices edged 
  higher. Excluding food and energy items, consumer prices advanced at 
  a slightly slower rate over October and November than in earlier 
  months of the year and also increased a little less over the twelve 
  months ended in November than over the comparable year-earlier period. 
  At the producer level, prices of finished goods other than food and 
  energy were down over the October-November period, but they rose by a 
  little larger amount for the twelve months ended in November than they 
  had in the year-earlier period. The increase in average hourly 
  earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers over the October-November period remained in the moderate range that had prevailed for 
  some time, although a pickup in earnings growth was evident in a few 
  sectors, notably construction and services. Over the past twelve 
  months, hourly earnings increased at a slightly faster pace than they 
  had over the year-earlier period.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on November 15, 1994, the Committee adopted a 
  directive that called for a significant increase in the degree of 
  pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible rise of 
  3/4 percentage point in the discount rate. The Committee did not 
  include in the directive a presumption about likely further 
  adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, 
  the directive stated that in the context of the Committee's long-run 
  objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
  giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary 
  developments, somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint 
  would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve 
  conditions associated with this directive were expected to be 
  consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

[SECTION]

On the day of the meeting, the Board of Governors approved a 
  3/4 percentage point rise in the discount rate, to a level of 4-3/4 
  percent. The increase in the discount rate was made effective 
  immediately and was passed through fully to interest rates in the 
  market for reserves. Open market operations during the intermeeting 
  period were conducted with a view to maintaining the tighter policy 
  stance implemented immediately after the meeting, and the federal 
  funds rate remained near 5-1/2 percent. Adjustment plus seasonal 
  borrowing, reflecting the usual late-autumn pattern of ebbing demand 
  for seasonal credit, declined over the intermeeting period; actual 
  borrowing was close to anticipated levels.

[SECTION]

Short-term interest rates rose considerably over the period 
  after the November meeting. These rates had increased before the 
  meeting in anticipation of a policy tightening move, but the size of 
  the move was larger than expected and rates firmed a little further as 
  a result. Over the remainder of the intermeeting interval, short-term 
  rates responded to incoming economic data, for a time rising in 
  reaction to indications of continuing strength in economic activity 
  and later retracing a portion of these increases in response to 
  favorable news on inflation. Rates on private money-market 
  instruments with very short maturities also were lifted somewhat in 
  anticipation of the usual year-end pressures. Long-term rates 
  declined slightly over the intermeeting period. The more favorable 
  inflation data, together with the relatively aggressive tightening 
  action, apparently were viewed by many market participants as 
  indicating that monetary policy would be sufficiently firm to hold 
  inflation in check. The revelations in early December of financial 
  difficulties in Orange County, California and concerns about their 
  potential spread had a disruptive effect on financial markets, notably 
  those for municipal securities, but aside from the securities of the 
  affected communities, the disruption generally was brief. Most major 
  indexes of equity prices fell, on balance, over the intermeeting 
  period.

[SECTION]

The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other 
  G-10 currencies increased further over the intermeeting period, with 
  the dollar gaining about equally against the mark and the yen. The 
  unexpected size of the monetary policy move in November, the economic 
  news received over the period, and the growing expectation that policy 
  would be tightened again before long all appeared to contribute to the 
  dollar's rise.

[SECTION]

Growth of M2 resumed in November after several months of 
  decline. M2's expansion largely reflected sizable inflows to small 
  time deposits and retail money market funds that in part might have 
  been associated with accelerated outflows from bond mutual funds and 
  reduced inflows to stock mutual funds. M3 growth slowed a little in 
  November as some investors shifted funds from institution-only money 
  market accounts, whose opportunity costs had widened after the 
  November policy tightening, into direct holdings of securities. For 
  the year through November, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the 
  Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its 
  range for the year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had continued to 
  expand at a moderate rate in recent months, and through October 
  (latest data) this debt measure had grown at a rate in the lower half 
  of its monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
  growth of economic activity would slow markedly over the next few 
  quarters and then would average less than the rate of increase in the 
  economy's potential output over the remainder of the forecast horizon. 
  In the staff's judgment, the economy currently was operating beyond 
  its long-run noninflationary capacity, and the forecast assumed that 
  monetary policy would not accommodate any continuing tendency for 
  aggregate demand to expand at a pace that could foster sustained 
  higher inflation. Growth of consumer spending was expected to decline 
  substantially in response to slower income growth, higher borrowing 
  costs, and reductions in household net worth associated with lower 
  asset values. Business outlays for new equipment were projected to be 
  damped considerably by slower growth in sales, higher financing costs, 
  and declining profits. Homebuilding also was expected to soften in 
  response to higher financing costs, but the relatively favorable cash-flow affordability of housing was anticipated to act as a partial 
  offset to those increased costs. The projected robust pace of 
  economic activity abroad was expected to bolster export demand. With 
  the economy having exceeded its noninflationary potential in the 
  staff's judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up 
  for a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources 
  eased.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
  economic developments, members referred to continuing indications of 
  robust expansion in employment, output, and spending and to very high 
  and rising levels of resource utilization. They saw scant evidence at 
  this point of any moderation in the growth of overall economic 
  activity, including little apparent response thus far in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy to earlier policy tightening actions. 
  Several observed that much of the expansionary momentum in the economy 
  was likely to carry into at least the early part of next year, with 
  potential inflationary consequences, but a number also commented that 
  appreciable slowing during the year to a more sustainable and less 
  inflationary pace remained a reasonable expectation. It was likely 
  that much of the restraint from the policy firming actions implemented 
  this year had not yet been experienced; those actions had reversed an 
  accommodative policy that had been in place through early 1994, the 
  effects of which probably were still being felt in the latter part of 
  1994. The members acknowledged that the timing and extent of the 
  slowing in the expansion were subject to considerable uncertainty. 
  However, with the economy now operating at or even slightly above its 
  noninflationary potential, price and wage pressures were likely to 
  build unless the anticipated slowing occurred relatively soon. Key 
  measures of inflation including consumer prices, wages, and producer 
  prices of finished goods did not display any evident uptrend at this 
  juncture, but this could reflect a delay in the adjustment of 
  inflation to capacity constraints and possibly some greater 
  productivity and flexibility in the economy than had been assumed.

[SECTION]

In the course of the Committee's discussion, members reported 
  on regional business conditions, which continued to exhibit local 
  variations ranging from modest expansion in some areas to robust 
  growth in others. Reflecting widespread strength in new orders, 
  manufacturing firms outside the defense industry typically were 
  operating at high levels of capacity utilization, and there were 
  numerous anecdotal reports of tightening labor markets. As they had 
  at earlier meetings, members remarked that despite the increases that 
  had occurred in interest rates, financial conditions remained 
  generally supportive of vigorous economic activity. Some noted that 
  the financial markets were displaying a great deal of resilience and 
  in particular that they had on balance weathered fairly readily the 
  recent financial problems of a number of local governments and private 
  corporations that had experienced large unanticipated losses on their 
  investments. Banking institutions remained aggressive in their 
  efforts to extend loans to businesses and consumers.

[SECTION]

In their comments on developments in key sectors of the 
  economy, members noted that consumer spending had increased briskly in 
  recent months amid indications of favorable consumer sentiment that in 
  turn undoubtedly reflected the rapid growth in employment and income. 
  It was still too early to form reliable estimates of retail sales in 
  the current holiday season. The anecdotal reports pointed to seasonal 
  increases ranging from moderate to strong in various regions, but some 
  members emphasized that sales volumes were being buttressed by unusual 
  promotional efforts, including relatively large discounts. Some 
  members also commented that consumer debt was growing rapidly and that 
  increased debt levels were likely to exert a retarding effect on 
  consumer spending, especially if consumer loan rates were to be 
  adjusted more fully upward to reflect increases in market interest 
  rates. Rates on adjustable home mortgages were moving higher to catch 
  up with market rates and these increases along with the wealth effects 
  from losses suffered on bond and stock holdings were likely to damp 
  spending. Up to now, however, the members saw few signs of any 
  moderation in the growth of consumer spending, including little 
  apparent effect from somewhat higher interest rates on normally 
  interest-sensitive spending for motor vehicles and other consumer 
  durables.

[SECTION]

Business fixed investment, which was contributing substantially to the current strength of the expansion, was likely to remain 
  a positive factor in sustaining the overall growth of the economy 
  during the year ahead. Even so, as the expansion matured and growth 
  in final demand tended to moderate, business investment could be 
  expected to soften. As in the case of consumer spending, however, 
  there were few signs of any slowing in the current data or anecdotal 
  reports. Indeed, members saw growing indications of some improvement 
  in nonresidential construction activity as brisk economic expansion 
  tended to absorb increasing amounts of previously vacant commercial 
  and industrial space and prices of such facilities tended to firm. In 
  the homebuilding sector, the latest available data did not indicate 
  any weakening in housing construction despite the rise in mortgage 
  interest rates. However, anecdotal reports from different parts of 
  the country suggested that the single-family sector might be 
  weakening. At the same time, construction of multifamily units 
  continued to exhibit strength in a number of areas, and this sector 
  appeared to be on a gradual uptrend as falling vacancy rates brought 
  increases in rents. On balance, some modest softening in overall 
  housing construction was seen as likely in response to the rise that 
  had occurred in mortgage interest rates.

[SECTION]

Inventory investment was cited as another sector of the 
  economy that probably would exert a negative influence on economic 
  activity over the year ahead, though inventory developments are always 
  subject to a great deal of uncertainty. The strength of inventory 
  investment in recent quarters reflected efforts to accommodate rapid 
  growth in final demand and avoid disruptions to production in a period 
  when supply delivery times were tending to lengthen. Inventory 
  accumulation might remain elevated for a while longer, but as the 
  projected slowing in the growth of final demand began to materialize, 
  business firms were likely to curtail the growth of their 
  inventories, perhaps sharply for some period, in order to maintain 
  desired inventory-to-sales ratios.

[SECTION]

The government sector constituted another source of 
  considerable uncertainty in the outlook for 1995. Members referred 
  to major fiscal policy initiatives that were likely to be considered 
  in the new Congress, and they discussed possible short-and long-term 
  effects on the economy. However, the shape of any legislation was 
  still to be determined and it was not possible at this point to gauge 
  its effects on government or private spending. On the other hand, 
  spending by state and local governments was clearly trending higher 
  and was likely to provide a mild impetus to the overall expansion; the 
  financial difficulties of some local governments undoubtedly would 
  serve to curb their spending but were not seen at this point as having 
  any significant effect on the growth in overall expenditures by state 
  and local governments.

[SECTION]

With regard to the external sector of the economy, members 
  continued to anticipate strengthening markets for U.S. exports over 
  the year ahead. Projected growth in exports would be stimulated by 
  the further expansion of economic activity in major U.S. trading 
  partners and by the delayed effects of the weakening of the dollar 
  that had occurred on balance over the course of 1994. Some members 
  cited anecdotal indications of stronger foreign demand for 
  agricultural and other goods produced in the United States.

[SECTION]

Despite the evidence of vigorous expansion in overall 
  economic activity and very high levels of resource use, broad measures 
  of inflation in markets for finished goods and overall wage inflation 
  had been on the low side of expectations recently. Anecdotal reports 
  continued to point to very strong competition in most markets for 
  final goods, and business firms continued to encounter widespread 
  resistance in their efforts to increase prices as the costs of their 
  raw materials and other inputs moved higher. Likewise, no uptrend 
  currently was discernible in broad measures of wages even though labor 
  markets were widely described as tight and labor shortages appeared to 
  have increased further recently in some parts of the country. While 
  examples of upward pressures on wages could be found in a number of 
  industries, such as construction where there were pronounced shortages 
  of skilled labor in many local areas, most business firms were 
  strongly resisting sizable increases in their wages and were making 
  use of "hiring bonuses" and "performance bonuses" instead of 
  permanently higher wages to attract or retain workers. At the same 
  time, job insecurities, including the potential loss of health and 
  pension benefits, appeared to be holding down labor mobility and 
  demands for higher compensation. However, many members commented that 
  rising pressures on capacity, should they persist or intensify, could 
  be expected to foster greater inflation at some point. Indeed, there 
  were numerous reports of business plans to raise prices early in the 
  new year, and a number of members commented that inflation probably 
  would worsen somewhat over the near term. The subsequent behavior of 
  prices and wages would depend importantly on fiscal and monetary 
  policy developments, the extent of inflationary expectations among 
  businesses and consumers, and the degree of pressure that further 
  economic expansion would exert on capacity in various industries and 
  occupations. Given their projections of some moderation in the 
  business expansion and assuming appropriate fiscal and monetary 
  policies, the members generally felt that any added inflation emerging 
  in 1995 would likely be mild and could subside gradually during the 
  year.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
  period ahead, a majority of the members agreed on the desirability of 
  maintaining an unchanged policy posture at least through the beginning 
  of 1995. Monetary policy had been tightened considerably in a series 
  of steps starting in February, and much of the restraint stemming from 
  those policy moves had not yet been felt in the economy. This was 
  especially true with regard to the effects of the latest policy moves 
  in August and November, which accounted for half the total tightening. 
  In the circumstances, a pause seemed warranted to give the Committee 
  more time to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the 
  impact of previous monetary restraint. This would provide a firmer 
  basis for gauging the appropriate scope and timing of any further 
  monetary restraint that might be needed to contain inflation. The 
  level of real short-term interest rates, which had risen considerably 
  this year and were now significantly positive, the uniformly sluggish 
  behavior of the monetary aggregates, and the recent appreciation of 
  the dollar might indicate that policy was now better positioned to 
  restrain incipient inflation. It was noted that the Committee might 
  have gained some leeway to maintain an unchanged policy without 
  adverse expectational effects in light of the relatively large policy 
  tightening implemented just a few weeks ago and the publication of 
  favorable price and wage data that probably had alleviated, at least 
  temporarily, concerns about future inflation. A number of members 
  also commented that financial markets might tend to be a bit unsettled 
  over the balance of the year as a result of the expected year-end 
  adjustments along with the uncertainty about the effects and incidence 
  of the sizable market losses incurred by some investors in 1994. In 
  these circumstances, where there did not appear to be an urgent need 
  for a further policy move, a number of members viewed conditions in 
  financial markets as arguing for a steady policy course pending a 
  reassessment early next year.

[SECTION]

A few members expressed a preference for some additional 
  tightening of policy at this meeting. In their view, the considerable 
  strength of the economic expansion and the high level of resource 
  utilization argued for further monetary restraint to counter 
  inflationary pressures; immediate action also would moderate 
  inflationary expectations by reinforcing the credibility of the 
  System's anti-inflationary effort. All but one of these members 
  indicated, however, that they could accept an unchanged directive that 
  was biased toward possible firming during the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

On the issue of possible adjustments to policy during the 
  period until the next meeting, a majority of the members expressed a 
  preference for an asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. While 
  most of these members preferred not to tighten policy at this point, 
  they believed that the need for further monetary restraint was highly 
  likely, though it would remain contingent on the tenor of the new 
  information, including data on holiday retail sales, that would begin 
  to arrive shortly after the turn of the year. Should the need for 
  more restraint become apparent, it would be desirable in this view for 
  the appropriate policy move to be made promptly to arrest any 
  worsening of inflation and inflationary expectations, thereby 
  minimizing the cumulative policy tightening that would be required and 
  the ultimate cost of bringing inflation under control. The Committee 
  always had the option of adjusting its policy during intermeeting 
  periods even under a symmetric directive, but the balance of risks in 
  the outlook argued in the view of these members for a policy reaction 
  to new information that was best characterized by an asymmetric 
  directive.

[SECTION]

The other members who favored an unchanged policy preferred a 
  symmetric directive. In their view, the information that would be 
  released in the weeks immediately ahead was not likely to depart 
  sufficiently from current expectations to warrant a policy tightening 
  move during the intermeeting period. Moreover, current forecasts were 
  subject to some risks in both directions. Those in the direction of 
  appreciably greater-than-projected slowing in the expansion might have 
  a relatively low probability, at least over the quarters immediately 
  ahead, but that risk could not be ruled out and argued for a cautious 
  approach to any further tightening. Accordingly, the Committee should 
  wait until the next scheduled meeting when more information, possibly 
  including a better assessment of the outlook for fiscal policy, would 
  be available for evaluating the need for any further firming of 
  monetary policy. One member expressed the view that it would be 
  desirable to make any further short-run policy moves in the context of 
  the Committee's long-run strategy to be considered at the next 
  meeting. Despite their preferences, these members said that they 
  would not dissent from an asymmetric directive.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one 
  member indicated that they could support a directive that called for 
  maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and 
  that included a bias toward the possible firming of reserve conditions 
  during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the 
  Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable 
  economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
  financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that 
  somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly 
  lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting 
  period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were 
  expected to be consistent with modest growth in the broader monetary 
  aggregates over coming months.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
  New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
  the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
  accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    a further pickup in economic growth in recent months. 
    Nonfarm payroll employment rose sharply in November, 
    and the civilian unemployment rate declined to 5.6 
    percent. Industrial production registered another 
    large increase in November and capacity utilization 
    moved up further from already high levels. Retail 
    sales have continued to rise rapidly. Housing starts 
    increased appreciably in November. Orders for 
    nondefense capital goods point to a continued strong 
    expansion in spending on business equipment; permits 
    for nonresidential construction have been trending 
    higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and 
    services widened somewhat in October from its average 
    rate in the third quarter. Prices of many materials 
    have continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of 
    prices for consumer goods and services have increased 
    moderately on average over recent months.

On November 15, 1994, the Board of Governors 
    approved an increase from 4 to 4-3/4 percent in the 
    discount rate, and in line with the Committee's 
    decision the increase was allowed to show through fully 
    to interest rates in reserve markets. In the period 
    since the November meeting, short-term interest rates 
    have risen considerably while long-term rates have 
    declined slightly. The trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies recovered 
    further over the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

Growth of M2 resumed in November after several 
    months of decline, while M3 expanded moderately 
    further. For the year through November, M2 grew at a 
    rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 1994 
    and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the 
    year. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has continued 
    to expand at a moderate rate in recent months and for 
    the year-to-date it has grown at a rate in the lower 
    half of its monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
    meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 
    percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 
    1994. The Committee anticipated that developments 
    contributing to unusual velocity increases could 
    persist during the year and that money growth within 
    these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy 
    objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total 
    domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 
    percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed 
    on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 
    1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for 
    M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated 
    monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial 
    debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the 
    monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in 
    the light of progress toward price level stability, 
    movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
    economy and financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
    future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
    degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
    giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
    and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve 
    restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
    might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
    contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
    consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming 
    months.

Vote against this action: Mr. LaWare.

[SECTION]

Mr. LaWare dissented because he favored an immediate policy 
  tightening action. In his opinion, the expansion remained quite 
  strong, with high and increasing levels of utilization in labor and 
  capital markets, and he saw a serious risk of rising inflation. In 
  the circumstances, he also feared that a failure by the Committee to 
  take restraining action could heighten inflationary expectations by 
  raising concerns about the System's commitment to the objective of 
  sustainable, noninflationary economic growth.

Temporary Increase in Reciprocal Currency Agreement with Bank of Mexico.

[SECTION]

At a meeting conducted via a telephone conference on December 
  30, 1994, the Committee approved a temporary increase from $3 billion to 
  $4-1/2 billion in the System's reciprocal currency (swap) agreement with 
  the Bank of Mexico; it was understood that all drawings, including those 
  under the permanent tranche of the System's swap agreement with the Bank 
  of Mexico, would be subject to a determination that appropriate terms 
  and conditions had been met. The U.S. Treasury also increased its swap 
  facility with the Bank of Mexico by $1-1/2 billion to $4-1/2 billion, 
  thereby raising the total for official U.S. facilities to $9.0 billion. 
  The increases were in response to recent financial developments in 
  Mexico. The Committee was informed at this meeting that the Bank of 
  Canada would be considering an increase in its own CAN $1.0 billion 
  facility with the Bank of Mexico, and that additional official financing 
  assistance was being negotiated with the other G-10 central banks and 
  the Bank of Spain.

Absent and not voting: Mr. Forrestal and Ms. 
  Phillips. Mr. Melzer voted as alternate for Mr. 
  Forrestal.

[SECTION]

Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to question the 
  desirability of the System's foreign exchange market intervention and 
  therefore the desirability of maintaining or enlarging the swap 
  arrangements that facilitate them. In his view continued System 
  participation in such operations with the U.S. Treasury presented an 
  unacceptable risk of reducing the System's credibility and its ability 
  to conduct monetary policy effectively. He felt this risk was 
  particularly high in this instance. Moreover, as at the March 22, 
  1994, meeting of the Committee, he had serious concerns about the 
  appropriateness of the foreign exchange operations this particular 
  enlargement would support. In his view, the expansion of this 
  arrangement was equivalent in many respects to a fiscal policy 
  initiative of a kind that should be explicitly authorized by the 
  Congress.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 
  held on Tuesday-Wednesday, January 31-February 1, 1995.
