  Washington, D.C., beginning on Tuesday, July 5, 1994, at 2:30 p.m. and 
  continuing on Wednesday, July 6, 1994, at 9:00 a.m.

Secretary's Note: Advice had been received that Alan S. 
    Blinder had executed his oath of office as a member of the 
    Federal Open Market Committee.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal 
  Open Market Committee held on May 17, 1994, were approved.

[SECTION]

The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments 
  in foreign exchange markets and on System open market transactions in 
  foreign currencies during the period May 17, 1994, to July 5, 1994.

[SECTION]

The Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, 
  McDonough, Blinder, Broaddus, Forrestal, Kelley, 
  LaWare, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.

[SECTION]

Votes against this action: Messrs. Jordan and 
  Lindsey.

[SECTION]

Messrs. Jordan and Lindsey dissented from this action, 
  although they agreed that the foreign exchange transactions conducted 
  during the intermeeting period were authorized under the Committee's 
  rules. Their dissents were based on their strong reservations about 
  the efficacy of sterilized intervention in most circumstances, 
  including those prevailing during the intermeeting period. In their 
  view, to the extent that repeated intervention failed to achieve 
  stated or perceived objectives, questions would tend to arise about 
  the credibility of monetary policy more generally.

[SECTION]

The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments 
  in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions 
  in government securities and federal agency obligations during the 
  period May 17, 1994, to July 5, 1994. By unanimous vote, the 
  Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
  financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the 
  intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
  information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
  Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
  policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that 
  economic activity recorded another substantial gain in the second 
  quarter. Although consumer spending and homebuying apparently had 
  increased at a slower pace, business spending on durable equipment 
  remained quite strong and investment in nonresidential structures 
  rebounded from a weather-depressed level in the first quarter. In 
  addition, the rate of nonfarm inventory investment evidently had 
  picked up in the second quarter. Levels of resource utilization had 
  risen further: factory operating rates were at relatively high levels, 
  and the slack in labor markets had narrowed considerably over the 
  first half of the year to what appeared to be very low levels. 
  Increases in consumer and producer prices had remained moderate in 
  recent months, but prices of many basic industrial materials had 
  risen.

[SECTION]

Nonfarm payroll employment advanced somewhat less rapidly in 
  May after the brisk increases of recent months; however, the average 
  workweek of production and nonsupervisory workers reached its highest 
  level since 1987. The reduction in job gains was widespread by 
  sector--including business services; finance, insurance, and real 
  estate; manufacturing; and construction. Employment in transportation 
  rebounded, reflecting the end of a Teamsters strike. The civilian 
  unemployment rate, measured on the new basis introduced in January, 
  declined sharply in May, to 6.0 percent; the decline might have been 
  overstated as a result of seasonal adjustment problems, but even after 
  correcting for these factors, the unemployment rate had fallen sharply 
  since late 1993.

[SECTION]

The rise in industrial production slackened in April and May 
  after strong first-quarter gains. Much of the slowing was the result 
  of capacity constraints that prevented normal seasonal increases in 
  the production of motor vehicles. Growth of output of manufactured 
  goods other than motor vehicles and parts was at a slightly less 
  robust pace than in the first quarter but close to the rapid rate seen 
  in 1993; business equipment and construction supplies continued to be 
  areas of strength. The overall rate of utilization in manufacturing 
  stayed at a high level in May, with most major industry groups 
  operating at or near capacity. In addition to motor vehicles, 
  capacity constraints were evident in the petroleum products and 
  nonelectrical machinery industry groups and in some individual product 
  lines in other industries.

[SECTION]

Real personal consumption expenditures fell on balance in 
  April and May after a strong advance earlier in the year, but the 
  level of expenditures for the two months combined was a little above 
  the first-quarter average. The recent slowdown in consumer spending 
  in large part reflected reduced outlays for motor vehicles. Spending 
  for durable goods other than motor vehicles increased over April and 
  May at about the first-quarter pace. Outlays for nondurable goods 
  were down on balance in April and May, while spending for services in 
  May more than reversed a small April decline. Housing activity had 
  rebounded from weather disruptions early in the year to a pace close 
  to the elevated fourth-quarter rate. Single-family starts edged down 
  in May after declining substantially in April but were still at a 
  relatively high level. While the cash-flow affordability of home 
  ownership had fallen since late last year, it remained at favorable 
  levels in comparison with recent years. Multifamily starts in May 
  were at their highest level in more than three years; most of the 
  pickup occurred in the South, where vacancy rates had declined 
  recently.

[SECTION]

Shipments of nondefense capital goods other than aircraft and 
  parts posted a further solid gain in May, although the upward trend 
  appeared to have moderated in recent months. Sales of heavy trucks 
  also were strong in April and May. Shipments of aircraft declined 
  sharply in April (latest available data), retracing much of a March 
  surge. Available data on orders for nondefense capital goods pointed 
  to a continued strong uptrend in business spending on durable 
  equipment. Nonresidential construction picked up in April and May 
  from a weather-depressed slump in the first quarter.

[SECTION]

Business inventories increased in April, more than reversing 
  a March runoff; the overall pace of accumulation remained moderate, 
  and buildups were largely concentrated in segments of the economy 
  where market demand was robust. In manufacturing, inventories 
  increased in April and May after a small drawdown in March. The rise 
  in stocks was in line with shipments, and the ratio of stocks to 
  shipments stayed at a very low level. In April (latest available 
  data), wholesale inventories retraced most of the sizable March 
  drawdown. The ratio of inventories to sales in this sector remained 
  below the range that has prevailed in recent years. At the retail 
  level, inventory stocks again edged higher; the inventory-to-sales 
  ratio for this sector was well within the range observed over the past 
  year.

[SECTION]

The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
  widened in April but was little changed from the average for the first 
  quarter; over the first four months of 1994, the deficit was 
  significantly larger than that recorded in the fourth quarter of last 
  year. The value of exports of goods and services was down somewhat in 
  April, retracing part of a sharp runup in March. The uptrend in 
  exports since last fall has been led by shipments of machinery, 
  especially to expanding markets in Asia. The value of imports of 
  goods and services was about the same in April as in March; increases 
  in consumer goods, machinery, and oil were offset by declines in other 
  categories. The economies of all the major foreign industrial 
  countries expanded in the first quarter of 1994. Growth resumed in 
  Japan, western Germany, and France, while economic expansion continued 
  at a healthy pace in the United Kingdom and Canada.

[SECTION]

Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had risen 
  moderately through the first five months of the year. In May, the 
  rise in the overall index of consumer prices continued to be held down 
  by declines in energy prices. Excluding the food and energy 
  components, the increase in consumer prices in the twelve months 
  ending in May was smaller than that for the previous twelve months. 
  Producer prices of finished goods continued to edge lower in May, 
  reflecting further declines in prices of finished foods and energy 
  goods. Producer prices for items other than food and energy increased 
  at a faster rate in May, but the change over the twelve-month period 
  ending in May was very small. At an earlier stage of processing, 
  producer prices of crude materials other than food and energy 
  registered another small decline in May, although the index was 
  substantially higher in May than a year ago. Furthermore, prices of 
  many basic industrial materials had remained under upward pressure. 
  Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers 
  increased by a larger amount in May than in April, but the rise over 
  the twelve months ended in May was about the same as in the previous 
  twelve months.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on May 17, 1994, the Committee adopted a 
  directive that called for increasing somewhat the degree of pressure 
  on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the 
  discount rate. The directive did not include a presumption about the 
  likely direction of any further adjustment to policy during the 
  intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the context of the 
  Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable 
  economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
  financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly 
  lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting 
  period. The reserve conditions associated with this directive were 
  expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over coming 
  months.

[SECTION]

Immediately after the conclusion of the May meeting, the 
  Board of Governors approved a 1/2 percentage point increase in the 
  discount rate, to 3-1/2 percent, and the Committee permitted the full 
  amount of the increase to pass through to interest rates in reserve 
  markets. Thereafter, open market operations were conducted with a 
  view to maintaining the less accommodative degree of reserve pressure 
  sought by the Committee. After the policy change, the federal funds 
  rate rose 1/2 percentage point, to 4-1/4 percent, and remained at 
  about that level over the intermeeting period. Adjustment plus 
  seasonal borrowing trended higher over the intermeeting period, 
  reflecting the usual seasonal pickup in lending activity, and averaged 
  close to anticipated levels.

[SECTION]

Market interest rates on instruments with more than three-month maturities moved lower immediately following the announcement of 
  the Committee's action, although some very short-term interest rates 
  moved up. The commercial bank prime rate also was raised by 1/2 
  percentage point, to 7-1/4 percent. Market participants apparently 
  interpreted the policy actions and the accompanying announcement as 
  signaling that the System would not take further tightening actions as 
  soon as they had anticipated earlier. Incoming data suggesting 
  sluggish spending and subdued inflation tended to confirm these market 
  assessments. Late in the intermeeting period, however, bond yields 
  retraced these declines, partly in association with a weakening dollar 
  in foreign exchange markets and rising commodity prices. Most major 
  indexes of equity prices rose early in the intermeeting period, but 
  they then moved lower in sympathy with the declines in bond prices and 
  the dollar and ended the period with small losses.

[SECTION]

The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other 
  G-10 currencies fell significantly further on balance over the 
  intermeeting period. The renewed decline, which began toward the 
  middle of June, occurred in response to indications of an improved 
  economic outlook abroad, associated increases in foreign bond yields, 
  and heightened concerns about possible increases in U.S. inflation. 
  Developments suggesting less favorable prospects for progress in U.S. 
  Japanese trade negotiations also tended to strengthen the yen against 
  the dollar.

[SECTION]

The broad monetary aggregates were weaker than the Committee 
  anticipated at the time of its previous meeting, with both M2 and M3 
  declining on average over May and June. The declines appeared to be 
  related in part to the continuing appeal of capital market 
  instruments. More generally, however, the rise in short-and long-term interest rates since the beginning of 1994, coupled with the 
  reluctance of banks and other depository institutions to adjust their 
  offering rates promptly, had produced a widening of the opportunity 
  costs of holding deposits and had led households to move deposit 
  monies into direct and indirect holdings of market instruments. For 
  the year through June, both M2 and M3 were at the bottom of the 
  Committee's ranges for 1994, and total domestic nonfinancial debt had 
  expanded at a moderate rate in the lower half of its monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
  the economy was operating at a level close to capacity and that the 
  expansion would slow over the next several quarters to a rate 
  generally in line with the growth of the economy's potential. To the 
  extent that aggregate demand tended to expand at a pace that could 
  foster higher inflation, it would not be accommodated by monetary 
  policy, and pressures would be generated in financial markets that 
  would restrain domestic spending. Consumer spending, which had been 
  increasing faster than household income for some time, was expected to 
  moderate as smaller gains in employment and income, coupled with 
  higher interest rates and reductions in the value of household 
  financial assets, exerted a restraining influence on consumption 
  patterns. Business fixed investment was projected to continue at a 
  brisk pace, although growth would be damped somewhat by the expected 
  deceleration in economic activity, a growing shortfall of corporate 
  cash flow relative to capital outlays, and higher financing costs. 
  The effects of higher mortgage interest rates were expected to cause 
  some slowing in the relatively robust pace of single-family 
  homebuilding. The restraint on output growth exerted by weak export 
  demand was expected to diminish because of the lower value of the 
  dollar and the somewhat faster recovery now projected in economic 
  activity abroad. The staff analysis suggested that, with the economy 
  already operating close to its long-run potential, no further 
  reduction in the core rate of inflation was likely over the forecast 
  horizon.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
  economic developments, members commented that the expansion continued 
  to display considerable momentum, with business activity apparently 
  still increasing at a pace above the economy's long-run growth 
  potential. At the same time, indications of some slowing in aggregate 
  demand had tended to increase over the last few months. The extent of 
  that slowing remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially 
  in light of somewhat disparate data on employment and spending. 
  Nonetheless, it was generally agreed that, in the context of 
  appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, some moderation in economic 
  growth to a pace closer to that of the economy's long-run potential 
  was a reasonable expectation. Such a slowing seemed necessary to 
  forestall a buildup of inflation pressures in the view of many 
  members. A number of members emphasized that remaining margins of 
  unemployed labor and other production resources, while difficult to 
  assess, now appeared to be quite limited. Although views differed to 
  some degree, the members generally concluded that the various factors 
  affecting the course of inflation were likely to result, on balance, 
  in little change, or perhaps a small rise, in inflation over the 1994-1995 forecast horizon. Some members regarded the risks of a 
  significant divergence from their forecasts of economic growth and 
  inflation as fairly evenly balanced in either direction, but most 
  believed that those risks were tilted to the upside.

[SECTION]

In keeping with the usual practice at meetings when the 
  Committee considers its long-run objectives for growth of the money 
  and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal 
  Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members provided 
  specific individual projections of growth in real and nominal GDP, the 
  rate of unemployment, and the rate of inflation for the years 1994 and 
  1995. The central tendency of the forecasts of the rate of expansion 
  in real GDP for 1994 as a whole was 3 to 3-1/4 percent, a little below 
  the rate of growth estimated for the first half of the year; for 1995, 
  the projections had a central tendency of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent. 
  With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the forecasts centered on 
  growth rates of 5-1/2 to 6 percent for 1994 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent for 
  1995. The projections of more moderate growth in economic activity 
  were associated with rates of unemployment in a range of 6 to 6-1/4 
  percent in the fourth quarters of both 1994 and 1995, about the same 
  as the average unemployment rate in recent months. For the rate of 
  inflation, as measured by the CPI, the projections had a central 
  tendency of 2-3/4 to 3 percent for 1994 and 2-3/4 to 3-1/2 percent for 
  1995; both ranges represented a slight increase from the average rate 
  over the past year. Favorable developments in the food and energy 
  sectors, which had held down overall inflation measures over the past 
  several quarters, were not expected to continue and the drop in the 
  dollar would be exerting upward pressures on prices in coming 
  quarters.

[SECTION]

Pursuant to a request from the Chairman of the Senate Banking 
  Committee, the members considered extending their specific forecasts 
  by an additional year. Many expressed reservations about the 
  reliability and thus the usefulness of numerical forecasts extending 
  relatively far into the future. Moreover, they were concerned about 
  misunderstandings of specific long-range forecasts in relation to the 
  Committee's goals and the ongoing formulation of monetary policy. The 
  members concluded that, on balance, the Committee's policy intentions 
  and expectations would be conveyed more effectively by the Chairman in 
  his upcoming Congressional testimony through a discussion of the 
  important factors bearing on trends in economic growth, prices, and 
  unemployment; the uncertainties involved in projecting such variables; 
  and the role of monetary policy in achieving desired economic goals. 
  In the course of their discussion, Committee members noted that the 
  Administration's medium-term outlook contained reasonable estimates of 
  the trend growth in output.

[SECTION]

In their review of developments in different parts of the 
  country and sectors of the economy, members referred to indications of 
  continuing growth in regional business activity ranging from 
  relatively modest to quite robust across much of the nation; at the 
  same time, some areas such as California continued to experience 
  generally stagnant economic conditions. While solid growth seemed to 
  characterize the overall economy, the members saw increasing signs of 
  some slowing in many areas. Business and consumer sentiment generally 
  remained quite positive, although a number of members commented on a 
  new note of caution among some of their business contacts and some 
  shaving of industry forecasts for the balance of the year.

[SECTION]

Turning to the key consumer sector, members commented on 
  various indications of some moderation in the growth of expenditures. 
  Higher interest costs were cited by some business contacts as 
  constraining purchases of consumer durables, but members also referred 
  to the negative impact of persisting, highly visible cutbacks in 
  workforces by some major business firms and of growing consumer debt. 
  Some members also noted that supply constraints, such as limitations 
  on the availability of some popular automobile models, had tended to 
  curb the expansion in sales. Looking ahead, more moderate growth in 
  consumer spending seemed likely; apart from the direct effects of 
  higher interest rates on such spending, the prospectively less 
  ebullient housing sector was likely to retard demands for household 
  furnishings.

[SECTION]

Business fixed investment was thought likely to continue to 
  provide appreciable stimulus to the expansion, though to a diminishing 
  extent in the context of slower overall growth in economic activity 
  and higher financing costs. While spending for equipment was likely 
  to moderate considerably from the extraordinarily rapid increases 
  recorded over an extended period, ongoing business efforts to improve 
  operating efficiencies would probably sustain substantial further 
  growth in equipment outlays. Nonresidential construction expenditures 
  were expected to post moderate increases after stagnating earlier; in 
  this connection, a number of members observed that commercial vacancy 
  rates were declining in various metropolitan areas and improved demand 
  for space was likely to generate increased construction activity. 
  Although higher interest costs could have some restraining effect, 
  financing for such projects was more readily available than earlier. 
  The outlook for inventory investment remained uncertain. Some buildup 
  in inventories was occurring, but business firms were continuing to 
  resist sizable increases and inventory-to-sales ratios remained at 
  unusually low levels. Developments that might be expected to foster a 
  faster buildup, such as some lengthening of order lead times and 
  rising pressures on capacity in some industries, had not led to the 
  strengthening in inventory investment that had characterized 
  comparable stages of previous business cycle expansions.

[SECTION]

Members observed that the outlook for exports appeared to 
  have improved and that foreign trade, on net, probably would make a 
  small contribution to economic growth over the next several quarters. 
  Some noted that business contacts were reporting strong foreign demand 
  for various U.S. products. As members had noted at previous meetings, 
  the North American Free Trade Agreement appeared to have stimulated 
  increased trade between Mexico and the United States, although it was 
  still too early to gauge the extent of this development. More 
  generally, the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and 
  a somewhat greater strengthening in the economies of major trading 
  partners than was expected earlier had enhanced the prospects for 
  appreciable growth in U.S. exports, and in the view of at least some 
  members that growth might prove to be considerably greater than was 
  currently projected.

[SECTION]

Members remarked that uncertainties about remaining margins 
  of slack in the economy, accentuated by the change in the household 
  employment survey, and about potential levels of economic activity 
  over the quarters ahead made it particularly difficult to assess the 
  outlook for inflation. However, based on what seemed to be reasonable 
  estimates of resource utilization levels and their own projections 
  that the rate of economic growth would slow to a pace nearer the 
  economy's growth potential, the members generally concluded that the 
  rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, might remain about 
  unchanged or tilt slightly higher over the forecast horizon. This 
  conclusion took into account the effects of the decline in the foreign 
  exchange value of the dollar, the increase in oil prices on world 
  markets, and the at-least-temporary rise in food prices. Some members 
  observed that the overall behavior of prices had been somewhat more 
  favorable than they would have predicted, given the strength of the 
  expansion and the level of resource utilization. One explanation 
  could be that increases in overall capacity and productivity stemming 
  from business restructuring activities and investments in new 
  equipment and facilities had been greater than expected. Comments 
  from numerous business contacts around the country continued to 
  indicate that despite the rising costs of many materials used in the 
  production process, highly competitive markets rendered it very 
  difficult or impossible to pass these higher costs through to prices 
  of finished goods. At the same time, labor compensation increases had 
  remained subdued despite indications of shortages of some types of 
  labor in many parts of the country. Exceptions involving sizable wage 
  increases continued to be cited for some industries, such as 
  construction and trucking, that were operating at full capacity. 
  Nonetheless, in the absence of an uptrend thus far in consumer price 
  inflation and given continuing uncertainties about job prospects 
  despite large job gains, wage pressures had remained restrained.

[SECTION]

In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and 
  Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee 
  at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth in the monetary and 
  debt aggregates that it had established in February for 1994 and it 
  decided on tentative ranges for growth in those aggregates in 1995. 
  The current ranges set in February for the period from the fourth 
  quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994 included expansion of 
  1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. A monitoring range 
  for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set at 4 to 8 
  percent for 1994.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion, which as in the past tended to 
  focus on M2, all the members indicated that they were in favor of 
  retaining the current ranges for M2 and M3 for 1994 and extending 
  those ranges on a provisional basis to 1995. In their evaluation of 
  appropriate growth ranges for 1994, the members anticipated that the 
  projected moderation in the expansion of nominal GDP and the 
  likelihood that funds would continue to be diverted from deposits to 
  higher yielding market instruments would be reflected in relatively 
  sluggish growth in M2 and M3 and further increases in their velocity--the ratio of nominal GDP to these monetary measures. In the 
  circumstances, expected growth in M2 and M3 at rates around the lower 
  end of their ranges would be consistent with the Committee's overall 
  objective of fostering financial conditions that would promote 
  sustainable economic growth and contain pressures on prices. Indeed, 
  that objective might even imply a shortfall from one or both of the 
  current ranges, but shortfalls could be tolerated and explained if 
  they reflected greater-than-expected increases in velocity associated 
  with an acceptable economic performance. While growth of the broad 
  monetary aggregates might pick up somewhat next year, it probably 
  would remain damped relative to income. In light of this prospect, 
  and of the uncertainties about appropriate monetary growth in 1995, 
  the Committee decided to carry forward the 1994 ranges, subject to a 
  review early next year. The Committee noted that the current ranges, 
  which had been reduced greatly over the years, could be viewed as 
  long-run benchmarks for monetary growth consistent with maximum 
  sustainable economic expansion in a noninflationary environment, if 
  there were a return to more normal velocity behavior. The Committee 
  recognized that considerable uncertainty about the behavior of 
  velocity was likely to persist and that a broad range of financial and 
  economic indicators, in addition to the monetary aggregates, would 
  need to be monitored in determining the appropriate course for 
  monetary policy.

[SECTION]

In their review of the Committee's monitoring range for the 
  growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt, the members agreed that 
  the current range for 1994 should be retained. This view took into 
  account staff projections indicating that the debt aggregate was 
  likely to grow within its present range this year, albeit the lower 
  half of that range. Considerable sentiment was expressed, however, 
  for reducing the debt monitoring range for 1995. Debt growth was 
  expected to remain relatively subdued in association with projections 
  of a slower rate of expansion in nominal GDP. Lowering the range 
  would underscore the Committee's view that rapid debt growth, should 
  it materialize and be sustained, could have adverse implications for 
  inflation and financial stability. Members emphasized, however, that 
  action to adjust the debt range did not imply increased Committee 
  emphasis on the debt aggregate, and most believed that the risks of 
  any misinterpretation could be minimized by including an appropriate 
  explanation in the report to Congress.

At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to 
  reaffirm the ranges for growth of M2 and M3 and the monitoring range 
  for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt that it had established 
  in February for 1994. The following statement was approved for 
  inclusion in the Committee's domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the ranges it had established 
    in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent 
    and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the 
    fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 1994. 
    The Committee anticipated that developments contributing to unusual velocity increases could persist 
    during the year and that money growth within these 
    ranges would be consistent with its broad policy 
    objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total 
    domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 
    percent for the year.

For the year 1995, the Committee approved provisional ranges 
  for M2 and M3 that were unchanged from the 1994 ranges. The Committee 
  reduced the monitoring range for growth in total domestic nonfinancial 
  debt by one percentage point from 1994 to a range of 3 to 7 percent. 
  Accordingly, the Committee voted to incorporate the following 
  statement regarding the 1995 ranges in its domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

For 1995, the Committee agreed on tentative 
    ranges for monetary growth, measured from the fourth 
    quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995, of 1 to 
    5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. The 
    Committee provisionally set the associated monitoring 
    range for growth of domestic nonfinancial debt at 3 to 
    7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the monetary 
    aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light 
    of progress toward price level stability, movements in 
    their velocities, and developments in the economy and 
    financial markets.

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
  period ahead, most members endorsed a proposal to maintain an 
  unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The economy seemed 
  to be slowing, although to an uncertain extent. Earlier policy 
  tightening actions were being reflected in the sluggish behavior of 
  money and reserves, although the extent of their effects on spending 
  were still in question. Inflation was a concern, but direct evidence 
  of additional pressures on costs and prices was quite fragmentary. In 
  these circumstances, all but one of the members concluded that it 
  would be prudent for the Committee to assess further developments 
  before taking any action. One member believed that prompt further 
  tightening was needed to avert the development of greater inflation.

[SECTION]

In the discussion of the near-term course of policy, the 
  members took account of the substantial weakness of the dollar in 
  foreign exchange markets over the course of recent weeks. By itself, 
  the drop in the dollar could put some pressure on resources and 
  prices. However, the members agreed that these effects needed to be 
  considered in the context of overall prospects for the economy and 
  financial markets, and policy should not be focused narrowly on the 
  dollar alone. In any case, given the negative sentiment in the 
  foreign exchange markets, the effects on the dollar that would flow 
  from a small change in policy were uncertain. Ultimately, the most 
  effective support that monetary policy could provide for the dollar 
  was to foster the objectives of sustainable economic growth and 
  progress toward price stability.

[SECTION]

With regard to possible changes in policy during the 
  intermeeting period, a majority favored a change in the intermeeting 
  instruction in the directive from symmetry to asymmetry toward 
  restraint. Some of the members indicated that near-term developments 
  were not likely to call for an adjustment to policy. Nonetheless, the 
  risk of inflationary momentum in the expansion remained high, given an 
  economy that appeared to be operating at or very close to full 
  capacity, and they believed that the probable direction of the next 
  policy move was likely to be in the direction of restraint. Some 
  emphasized that such a move should be made promptly in response to 
  information suggesting a greater potential for inflation. In the view 
  of many, though not all, members the costs of policy errors were 
  asymmetrical at this point. The costs of reversing a policy stance 
  that turned out to be slightly too tight would be limited to somewhat 
  slower economic growth for a time; the expansion appeared to be so 
  well established at this juncture that the risks of a greater economic 
  adjustment were remote. On the other hand, a policy that turned out 
  to be unduly stimulative would foster greater inflation and 
  inflationary expectations that probably could be reversed only at the 
  cost of considerable disruption in financial markets and the economy. 
  It also was noted that an asymmetric directive would underscore the 
  Committee's determination to resist greater inflation; the asymmetry 
  could be viewed as a logical extension of the strategy adopted in 
  February to move to a policy stance consistent with averting 
  inflationary pressures in a firmly established expansion.

[SECTION]

Some members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric 
  directive. These members did not rule out the possible need for 
  further policy tightening, but they believed that the risks 
  surrounding current forecasts were about evenly weighted in both 
  directions. One member expressed strong reservations about the use of 
  an asymmetric directive on the grounds that such language made 
  intermeeting changes more likely and in the view of that member 
  markets reacted more favorably when actions were taken and announced 
  at regular meetings. However, all those favoring a symmetric 
  directive with an unchanged policy stance could accept an asymmetric 
  intermeeting instruction.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one 
  of the members indicated that they could support a directive that 
  called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
  positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of 
  reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in 
  the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
  and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
  economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided 
  that slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or 
  slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 
  intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this 
  meeting were expected to be consistent with modest growth in the 
  broader monetary aggregates over coming months.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
  New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
  the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
  accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    that economic activity recorded another substantial 
    gain in the second quarter, causing levels of resource 
    utilization to rise further. Increases in nonfarm 
    payroll employment have been relatively large on 
    average in recent months; the civilian unemployment 
    rate is reported to have declined to 6.0 percent in 
    May. The rise in industrial production slackened in 
    April and May, primarily because capacity constraints 
    prevented normal seasonal increases in the production 
    of motor vehicles. Growth in consumer spending has 
    slowed in recent months after very large increases in 
    February and March. Housing starts have rebounded from 
    winter disruptions to a pace close to the elevated 
    fourth-quarter level. Orders for nondefense capital 
    goods point to a continued strong uptrend in spending 
    on business equipment, while nonresidential construction has recovered from a weather-depressed level in 
    the first quarter. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade 
    in goods and services was larger in April than in March 
    but about unchanged from the average for the first 
    quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer and 
    producer prices have remained moderate in recent 
    months, though prices of many basic industrial 
    materials have risen.

[SECTION]

On May 17, 1994, the Board of Governors approved 
    an increase in the discount rate from 3 to 3-1/2 
    percent. Most market interest rates were up slightly 
    on balance since the May meeting; declines in bond 
    yields early in the intermeeting period were offset 
    later by market reactions to a weakening dollar in 
    foreign exchange markets and rising commodity prices. 
    The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the 
    other G-10 currencies was down significantly further on 
    balance over the intermeeting period, reflecting a 
    sizable drop since early June.

[SECTION]

M2 and M3 declined on average over May and June; 
    for the year through June, both M2 and M3 are at the 
    bottom of their ranges for 1994. Total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate 
    rate in recent months.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In

    in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent

    on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 
    1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for 
    M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated 
    monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial 
    debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the 
    monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in 
    the light of progress toward price level stability, 
    movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
    economy and financial markets.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
    future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
    degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
    giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
    and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
    restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
    might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
    contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
    consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming

Votes against this action: Mr. Broaddus.

[SECTION]

Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that additional 
  near-term tightening was necessary to contain inflation. The 
  tightening actions implemented thus far this year were moderate by 
  historical standards, and he doubted that they would prove sufficient 
  to prevent higher inflation given the strength of the economic 
  expansion, the minimal remaining margins of unemployed labor and other 
  producer resources, and inflationary expectations that he feared might 
  already be rising.

[SECTION]

Prior to the conclusion of this meeting, the members 
  discussed the desirability of announcing the outcome of a meeting when 
  no action to change policy was taken. Views differed on this issue, 
  but most of the members supported a proposal to provide a brief and 
  informal indication that the meeting had ended and that there would be 
  no further announcements. Since early February, a statement had been 
  released after each meeting, all of which had involved policy changes; 
  failure to take some step after this meeting to make clear that there 
  was no change to announce would lead for a time to a heightened degree 
  of uncertainty. With regard to future announcements, it was 
  understood that this issue along with other public disclosure 
  questions would be considered at a later meeting. The Committee's 
  decision regarding announcements would then be made public.

[SECTION]

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 
  held on Tuesday, August 16, 1994.
