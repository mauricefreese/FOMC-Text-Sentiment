By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal 
  Open Market Committee held on September 27, 1994, were approved.

[SECTION]

The Report of Examination of the System Open Market Account, 
  conducted by the Board's Division of Reserve Bank Operations and 
  Payment Systems as of the close of business on June 30, 1994, was 
  accepted.

[SECTION]

The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments 
  in foreign exchange markets and on System open market transactions in 
  foreign currencies during the period September 27, 1994, through 
  November 14, 1994. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these 
  transactions.

[SECTION]

The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments 
  in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions 
  in government securities and federal agency obligations during the 
  period September 27, 1994, through November 14, 1994. By unanimous 
  vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
  financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the 
  intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
  information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
  Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
  policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the 
  growth of the economy remained substantial. Consumer spending was 
  robust, business fixed investment continued on a strong upward trend, 
  and housing activity had been well sustained despite the increase in 
  mortgage interest rates over the past year. Business inventory 
  investment had been brisk since the spring, apparently in response to 
  the strong growth in final sales. Further sizable gains had been 
  recorded in industrial production and employment. Increases in labor 
  compensation were still moderate, although there were some tentative 
  signs of wage acceleration associated with the further tightening of 
  labor markets. Prices of many materials continued to move up rapidly, 
  but broad indexes did not indicate a pickup in consumer inflation.

[SECTION]

Nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in 
  October, with job gains widespread by industry. In the service-producing sector, retail trade posted a particularly large advance 
  while health and business services continued to record moderate 
  increases. Manufacturing employment was up in October after having 
  been unchanged in September; the rise was related partly to continued 
  job growth in automobile-and construction-related industries, but 
  payrolls also expanded in a number of other industries, including 
  textiles, paper, rubber, and plastics. Construction hiring slowed 
  after a large rise in September. Employment, as measured by the 
  household survey, increased by more than the labor force in October, 
  and the civilian unemployment rate edged down to 5.8 percent.

[SECTION]

Industrial production increased substantially in October 
  after having posted appreciable advances on balance in previous 
  months. Manufacturing output accounted for all of the October rise as 
  production declined again in the mining and utilities components. In 
  manufacturing, the pace of motor vehicle assemblies was unchanged, but 
  production in automotive-related industries was stepped up noticeably 
  and output of business equipment continued to expand vigorously. 
  Total utilization of industrial capacity climbed further in October 
  from already elevated rates.

[SECTION]

Consumer confidence remained at a high level, and retail 
  sales continued to rise rapidly in October. Automotive dealers 
  reported a large increase in sales, but strength also was evident 
  elsewhere: Furniture and appliance stores posted another appreciable 
  gain; apparel outlets registered a brisk rise; and spending at food 
  and general merchandise stores grew moderately. Housing starts rose 
  appreciably in September, reaching their highest level of the year. 
  Sales of new and existing homes were stronger in September, despite 
  the higher interest rates on both fixed-and adjustable-rate 
  mortgages that had prevailed since earlier in the year.

[SECTION]

Business capital spending remained on a solid uptrend. 
  Shipments of nondefense capital goods were brisk during the third 
  quarter, and with orders continuing to exceed shipments, already large 
  backlogs increased further for most types of business equipment. 
  Spending for transportation equipment grew at a healthy rate in the 
  third quarter; purchases of heavy trucks persisted at a very high 
  level, and spending for motor vehicles picked up after a second-quarter lull. Nonresidential construction activity advanced at a 
  reduced pace in the third quarter; however, permits for new 
  construction continued to trend higher.

[SECTION]

Business inventory investment apparently continued at a brisk 
  pace in the third quarter, with much of the accumulation occurring in 
  types of goods where sales were strong. Manufacturing stocks fell in 
  September, but for the third quarter as a whole they increased at the 
  same moderate rate as in the second quarter; the inventory-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing in September remained near the 
  historical low reached the previous month. At the wholesale level, 
  inventory accumulation slowed slightly in the third quarter, and the 
  inventory-to-sales ratio was in the lower end of its range over recent 
  years. Retail inventories surged in August (latest data available) 
  after having declined slightly in July. Nonetheless, the inventory-to-sales ratio for this sector remained near the middle of its range 
  in recent years.

[SECTION]

The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
  narrowed in August, but for July and August combined the deficit was 
  substantially larger than its second-quarter average. The value of 
  exports of goods and services rebounded in August, with increases 
  spread widely among automotive products, aircraft, agricultural 
  products, machinery, and consumer goods. The value of imports also 
  increased in August, but by a lesser amount than that of exports; much 
  of the rise reflected greater imports of automotive vehicles from 
  Canada. Economic activity continued to expand in the major foreign 
  industrial countries in the third quarter, but growth apparently was 
  at a more moderate pace than in the first half of the year.

[SECTION]

Consumer price inflation remained moderate in September. For 
  items other than the food and energy components, the increase in 
  consumer prices over the twelve months ending in September was 
  slightly smaller than the rise over the previous twelve months. At 
  the producer level, prices of finished goods declined, largely 
  reflecting a sharp fall in prices of finished energy goods. Excluding 
  food and energy items, producer prices edged up in September and had 
  risen slowly over the twelve months ending in September. At 
  intermediate stages of processing, prices of many materials, notably 
  industrial materials, had continued to move up rapidly. Total 
  compensation of private industry workers rose significantly less over 
  the four quarters ending in September than over the previous four 
  quarters, primarily reflecting a sharply smaller increase in benefit 
  costs. Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory 
  workers recorded a large gain in September after having expanded 
  moderately over previous months.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on September 27, 1994, the Committee adopted a 
  directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
  on reserve positions but included a bias toward possible firming 
  during the intermeeting period. The directive stated that in the 
  context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
  sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
  economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater 
  reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve 
  restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The 
  reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be 
  consistent with modest growth of M2 and M3 over the balance of the 
  year.

[SECTION]

Open market operations during the intermeeting period were 
  directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
  positions. As the need for seasonal credit waned over the period, 
  adjustment plus seasonal borrowing declined substantially, with actual 
  borrowing remaining close to anticipated levels. Apart from some 
  tightness in reserves markets around the end of the third quarter, the 
  federal funds rate averaged close to 4-3/4 percent.

[SECTION]

Most market interest rates rose appreciably over the period 
  since the September 27 meeting in response to incoming economic data 
  that generally indicated sustained momentum in final sales and 
  inventory investment and high levels of aggregate output relative to 
  the economy's potential. The strong economic data and persisting 
  upward pressures on prices at earlier stages of production appeared to 
  heighten concerns among market participants about inflationary 
  pressures and prospects for even more monetary tightening than had 
  previously been anticipated. Most major indexes of equity prices were 
  little changed on balance over the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other 
  G-10 currencies changed little on net over the intermeeting period. 
  The dollar trended lower over much of the period, apparently 
  reflecting market perceptions that inflation risks in the United 
  States were on the rise. In early November, after reaching a new 
  post-World War II low against the yen and a two-year low against the 
  mark, the dollar began to recover. The rebound in the value of the 
  dollar apparently was in part a response to U.S. intervention in 
  support of the dollar and heightened expectations of further monetary 
  tightening in the United States.

[SECTION]

M2 continued to edge lower in October; the weakness was 
  concentrated in its more-liquid deposit components, for which 
  opportunity costs had risen very substantially this year. M3 expanded 
  at a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in large-denomination time deposits issued to finance rapid loan growth and to 
  counter runoffs of nondeposit sources of funds. For the year through 
  October, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the Committee's range for 
  1994 and M3 at a rate in the lower half of its range for the year. 
  Total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to expand at a moderate 
  rate in recent months.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
  growth in economic activity would slow markedly over the next several 
  quarters and for a period would average less than the rate of increase 
  in the economy's potential output. In the staff's judgment, the 
  economy currently was operating at or beyond its long-run capacity, 
  and the forecast assumed that monetary policy would not accommodate 
  any continuing tendency for aggregate demand to expand at a pace that 
  could foster sustained higher inflation. The expansion of consumer 
  spending was projected to slow considerably in response to diminishing 
  pent-up demands, higher borrowing costs, and reduced income growth. 
  Business fixed investment also was anticipated to decelerate 
  appreciably in the context of smaller increases in sales and less 
  favorable financial conditions. Homebuilding was expected to be 
  damped by higher financing costs, although housing activity likely 
  would remain well above the depressed levels of recent years when 
  cash-flow affordability had been less favorable. The lower value of 
  the dollar and the favorable prospects for faster economic recovery 
  abroad were projected to bolster the demand for U.S. exports. With 
  the economy having reached or exceeded its long-run potential in the 
  staff's judgment, wage and price inflation was projected to pick up 
  for a period before turning down as pressures on productive resources 
  eased.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
  economic developments, members commented on widespread statistical and 
  anecdotal indications of considerably greater strength in the business 
  expansion than they had anticipated earlier, with numerous industries 
  now operating at or beyond historic, long-run capacity levels. They 
  saw few signs that growth in aggregate demand might be moderating 
  toward a more sustainable pace; nonetheless, they continued to view 
  some slowing as a reasonable expectation as the monetary policy 
  tightening actions implemented earlier exerted their lagged effects on 
  interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. At this point, increases 
  in prices of final goods and services and in wages generally did not 
  appear to be trending higher, but the members were concerned that 
  inflation would worsen as the effects of continuing strong demand, 
  rising production costs, and higher import prices increasingly were 
  felt in an environment where the utilization of labor and other 
  producer resources was already at, if not above, sustainable full 
  employment levels.

[SECTION]

The evidence of persisting growth in aggregate demand at a 
  pace appreciably above that of the economy's long-run potential and of 
  developing pressures on resources tended to be confirmed by anecdotal 
  reports of robust business expansion in many parts of the country and 
  growing difficulties in hiring and retaining some types of labor. 
  Ongoing cutbacks in some industries, such as defense, were tending to 
  hold down overall economic activity in a few regions, but all parts of 
  the country appeared to be experiencing at least modest economic 
  growth, including California where economic activity now seemed to 
  have turned up after an extended period of weakness. Sentiment among 
  retailers and other business contacts was widely reported to be quite 
  favorable. In addition, some members commented that despite higher 
  interest rates financial conditions generally remained conducive to 
  further business expansion. The lending constraints that had tended 
  to retard the expansion earlier seemed to have given way to 
  increasingly accommodative loan policies by depository institutions 
  and ready access to market sources of financing for many business 
  firms.

[SECTION]

In their assessment of the contribution of key sectors of the 
  economy to the expansion, members commented on the current strength of 
  consumer spending and also noted that business contacts were 
  expressing considerable optimism about the prospects for retail sales 
  over the holiday season. Consumer sentiment, as evidenced by survey 
  results and retailer comments, appeared to be at a high level. Some 
  moderation in the growth of consumer spending could be expected to 
  emerge next year for a variety of reasons, including reduced pent-up 
  demands and some anticipated slowing in the growth of employment and 
  consumer incomes. Members also noted that rising interest rates were 
  likely to damp consumer spending, notably for durable goods, though 
  there was little evidence of such a development thus far. A projected 
  softening in housing markets would contribute to slower growth in 
  demand for housing-related consumer durables.

[SECTION]

Expanding sales and favorable profit margins were fostering 
  strong growth in business fixed investment, and much of the momentum 
  in this sector probably would carry over into 1995. Some business 
  contacts reported that they were developing plans for major capital 
  outlays over coming months. As the year progressed, however, the 
  increases that had occurred in interest rates, and the possibility of 
  less receptive financial conditions more generally, should begin to 
  exert some inhibiting effects on business fixed investment, especially 
  if profit margins also were to fall in the context of rising labor and 
  other costs.

[SECTION]

With regard to the outlook for housing, members reported that 
  conditions were somewhat uneven across the country but that for the 
  nation as a whole rising mortgage rates had had surprisingly little 
  effect thus far on this typically interest-sensitive sector of the 
  economy. One reason, it was suggested, was the apparent willingness 
  of some homebuyers to accept higher mortgage rates at this point 
  because they expected rates to rise further later. Even so, the 
  members continued to anticipate some slowdown in housing construction 
  over coming quarters. Overall construction activity was likely to be 
  supported to some extent, however, by further gradual gains in 
  nonresidential construction, notably commercial and industrial 
  structures, and perhaps some continuing strength in multifamily 
  housing.

[SECTION]

After a surge in the second quarter, inventory investment 
  remained substantial in the third quarter and appeared to be 
  continuing at a robust pace in the current quarter. For a variety of 
  reasons, inventory accumulation might well be relatively brisk for 
  some period of time, given the favorable sales experience of numerous 
  business firms and the still quite low levels of inventories relative 
  to sales. Moreover, with capacity pressures in many industries 
  leading to some lengthening in delivery times, businesses would tend 
  to build inventories to support sales and avoid disruptions to 
  production schedules. Tending to confirm such an assessment were 
  anecdotal reports suggesting that recent additions to inventories were 
  largely intended and not the result of disappointing sales. An 
  inventory buildup at the pace recorded on average in the second and 
  third quarters would not be sustainable, but inventory investment was 
  likely to be relatively well maintained over coming months if 
  aggregate demand were to expand in line with current expectations.

[SECTION]

The members generally anticipated that the external sector of 
  the economy would provide some impetus to the expansion. The recent 
  depreciation of the dollar and strength in foreign economic activity 
  could be expected to boost real exports at a time when growth in real 
  imports was likely to moderate. The resulting improvement in the 
  nation's net trade position would, however, tend to exacerbate any 
  tendency for domestic demand to outrun the economy's output potential.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for prices, 
  the members saw considerable potential for higher inflation if growth 
  in demand and output continued at an unsustainable pace, placing added 
  pressures on labor and other producer resources. They noted 
  indications of greater inflation pressures, especially in the rising 
  prices of many materials used in the production process and the 
  increasing number of reports of labor shortages. To date, prices of 
  finished goods and services did not reflect those pressures and 
  overall wage inflation did not appear to be trending higher. Even so, 
  at least some modest worsening of inflation seemed quite likely over 
  the quarters immediately ahead, despite the persistence of strong 
  competition that continued to limit attempts to raise prices in most 
  markets. This view seemed to be reinforced by increasing reports of 
  successful efforts by some business firms to establish and sustain 
  higher prices and by numerous indications of business plans to raise 
  prices around year-end or the early part of next year. Other factors 
  that appeared to have adverse implications for the inflation outlook 
  included faster increases in import prices, and in the view of at 
  least some members the prospect of diminishing gains in productivity. 
  Moreover, as evidenced by the comments of some business contacts and 
  the behavior of financial markets, inflationary expectations might be 
  in the process of worsening, though such a development could not be 
  seen in broad survey results. To what extent such expectations would 
  become more pervasive and foster greater inflation momentum was very 
  difficult to gauge at this point. One member suggested that some 
  further rise in inflation might reflect a typical development in a 
  maturing cyclical expansion but that such a rise would not necessarily 
  augur a permanent uptick in inflation or even that progress toward 
  price stability would not continue to be made over time, provided 
  appropriate monetary policies were pursued.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
  period ahead, all the members agreed that the current stance of 
  monetary policy presented unacceptable risks of embedding higher 
  inflation in the economy. The expansion retained appreciably more 
  forward momentum and greater inflationary potential than the members 
  had anticipated, given the policy restraint implemented earlier this 
  year. The reasons for that outcome remained unclear. Among the 
  suggested explanations were that the earlier restraint appeared to 
  have had a less-than-expected effect on current economic conditions 
  and, in particular, on the more interest-sensitive sectors of the 
  economy. Some members also suggested that the underlying expansion 
  was stronger than they had anticipated, and a couple referred to the 
  possibility that the lingering effects from the accommodative policy 
  stance maintained through last year were larger than had been 
  expected. Moreover, additional monetary restraint seemed to be needed 
  to counteract the stimulative effects on domestic economic activity of 
  a number of atypical financial developments in a period of rising 
  interest rates; these included the easing of non-price credit terms by 
  depository institutions, the ample availability of funds in debt and 
  equity markets, and the depreciation of the dollar in foreign exchange 
  markets. The members recognized that monetary policy actions exerted 
  much of their effects after relatively long lags and that a 
  substantial portion of the restraint stemming from the earlier policy 
  actions undoubtedly had not yet been felt in the economy. They 
  agreed, nonetheless, that monetary policy was still insufficiently 
  restrictive in light of emerging inflationary signals in the economy. 
  Views differed to some extent, however, regarding the degree of 
  additional restraint that might be needed to foster the Committee's 
  objectives for sustainable, noninflationary economic growth.

[SECTION]

A majority of the members believed that an unusually sizable 
  firming of monetary policy was desirable at this time, and they 
  endorsed a proposal to tighten reserve conditions in line with a 3/4 
  percentage point increase in the discount rate that a number of 
  Federal Reserve Banks had proposed for approval by the Board of 
  Governors. In this view, the data becoming available in recent months 
  had suggested considerable resilience and underlying strength in 
  economic activity and rising risks of greater inflation pressures. A 
  somewhat aggressive tightening action would improve the prospects for 
  curbing intensifying inflationary pressures before they gathered 
  further momentum and would help position the economy on a sustainable 
  growth path consistent with the economy's long-run potential. The 
  members acknowledged the difficulty of judging the precise degree of 
  monetary restraint that would be needed to attain the Committee's 
  objectives and in particular the risk that further efforts to control 
  inflation at this juncture might foster greater-than-intended 
  weakening of the expansion. The Committee could not prejudge how 
  much, if any, additional monetary restraint might be needed in the 
  future. That would depend on further developments, but for most 
  members a sizable move at this point represented the most appropriate 
  balance among the competing risks. During this discussion, it was 
  noted that recent developments were having an unsettling effect on 
  financial markets, and a tightening move of this magnitude might 
  contribute to market stability by reducing expectations of higher 
  inflation and a further near-term policy action. Some members also 
  commented that the action would tend to reinforce the recent 
  intervention in the foreign exchange markets.

[SECTION]

Other members indicated that they preferred a less forceful 
  policy move at this point, one that would be consistent with the 1/2 
  percentage point increase in the discount rate that had been proposed 
  by several Federal Reserve Banks. In their view, substantial further 
  restraint could be expected from the combined effects of the policy 
  tightening actions implemented earlier this year and the inevitable 
  waning of the stimulative effects of policy actions taken in previous 
  years. While the need for further monetary restraint could not be 
  ruled out, a more limited policy move at this point could reasonably 
  be expected in this view to accomplish the greater part or all of the 
  Committee's anti-inflationary objectives over time and would minimize 
  the risk of setting policy on an overly restrictive course with 
  undesired consequences for the business expansion later. Moreover, a 
  cautious approach could lessen the risk that the Committee's policy 
  intentions would be misinterpreted, with some resulting damage to 
  consumer and business confidence and dislocation in financial markets. 
  Despite their reservations, these members indicated that they could 
  accept the degree of restraint preferred by the majority because of 
  the quite small difference in the effects of the alternative moves on 
  the economy over time.

[SECTION]

With regard to possible changes in policy during the period 
  until the next meeting, a majority of the members favored associating 
  the more substantial policy adjustment with a symmetric intermeeting 
  instruction. This preference was based on expectations that a further 
  policy action was not likely to be called for over the near term, 
  although a symmetric directive would not prevent an intermeeting 
  adjustment if near-term developments differed substantially from 
  expectations. One member expressed the view that the unusually large 
  move made it especially important to follow a steady policy course for 
  some period of time and to undertake any further firming only if new 
  information of a surprisingly strong nature were to be received. 
  Another member indicated a preference for an asymmetric directive 
  toward restraint because such a directive would be more consistent 
  with the likely need in his view for further monetary restraint to 
  contain inflationary forces in the economy.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all 
  the members indicated they could support a directive that called for a 
  significant increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions, 
  taking account of a possible increase of 3/4 percentage point in the 
  discount rate, and that did not include a presumption about the likely 
  direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. 
  Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
  price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful 
  consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the 
  Committee decided that somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve 
  restraint would be acceptable during the intermeeting period. 
  According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at 
  this meeting would be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over 
  coming months.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
  New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
  the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
  accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    that the growth of the economy has remained substantial. Nonfarm payroll employment advanced appreciably 
    further in October, and the civilian unemployment rate 
    edged down to 5.8 percent. Industrial production 
    registered a large increase in October after posting 
    sizable gains on average over other recent months, and 
    capacity utilization moved up further from already high 
    levels. Retail sales have continued to rise rapidly. 
    Housing starts rose appreciably in September. Orders 
    for nondefense capital goods point to a continued 
    strong expansion in spending on business equipment; 
    permits for nonresidential construction have been 
    trending higher. Inventory accumulation appears to 
    have continued at a brisk pace in the third quarter. 
    For July and August combined, the nominal deficit on 
    U.S. trade in goods and services widened from its 
    second-quarter average. Prices of many materials have 
    continued to move up rapidly, but broad indexes of 
    prices for consumer goods and services have increased 
    moderately on average over recent months.

[SECTION]

Most market interest rates have risen appreciably 
    since the September meeting. The trade-weighted value 
    of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was 
    essentially unchanged on balance over the intermeeting 
    period, though it was weaker through much of the 
    period.

[SECTION]

M2 contracted further in October while M3 expanded 
    at a moderate pace, buoyed by continued rapid growth in 
    large-denomination time deposits. For the year through 
    October, M2 grew at a rate at the bottom of the 
    Committee's range for 1994 and M3 at a rate in the 
    lower half of its range for the year. Total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt has continued to expand at a moderate 
    rate in recent months.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
    meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 
    percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 
    1994. The Committee anticipated that developments 
    contributing to unusual velocity increases could 
    persist during the year and that money growth within 
    these ranges would be consistent with its broad policy 
    objectives. The monitoring range for growth of total 
    domestic nonfinancial debt was maintained at 4 to 8 
    percent for the year. For 1995, the Committee agreed 
    on tentative ranges for monetary growth, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 
    1995, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for 
    M3. The Committee provisionally set the associated 
    monitoring range for growth of domestic nonfinancial 
    debt at 3 to 7 percent for 1995. The behavior of the 
    monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in 
    the light of progress toward price level stability, 
    movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
    economy and financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
    future, the Committee seeks to increase significantly 
    the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, 
    taking account of a possible increase in the discount 
    rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run 
    objectives for price stability and sustainable economic 
    growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
    financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater 
    reserve restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint 
    would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
    contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
    consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming 
    months.

Secretary's note: The meeting was recessed briefly at this 
    point and the members of the Board of Governors convened to consider 
    pending Reserve Bank proposals for increases in the discount rate. 
    After the conclusion of that meeting, the Presidents of the Federal 
    Reserve Banks were informed that the Board of Governors had approved an 
    increase of 3/4 percentage point in the discount rate, effective 
    immediately, and the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee then 
    resumed.

System Foreign Currency Arrangements

[SECTION]

The Committee considered the renewal of the System's currency 
  ("swap") arrangements with foreign central banks. These arrangements 
  normally have one-year maturities and, except for those with the Bank 
  of Canada and the Bank of Mexico, were due to mature on various dates 
  in December 1994.

[SECTION]

In the course of their review, the members discussed sterilized intervention by the Federal Reserve in the foreign exchange 
  markets. They generally agreed that in certain circumstances such 
  intervention serves a useful purpose, such as helping to counter 
  disorderly market conditions, but it normally would not be expected to 
  have lasting effects on the foreign exchange value of the dollar in 
  the absence of other policy adjustments. In the overwhelming number 
  of instances for more than a decade, the Federal Reserve has participated jointly with the U.S. Treasury in foreign exchange operations. 
  In the view of most members it seemed advisable to continue that 
  procedure, especially given the System's responsibilities for the 
  overall financial health of the economy and ongoing cooperation with 
  the Treasury regarding the nation's broad financial objectives. 
  Nonetheless, the apparently limited and temporary effectiveness of 
  sterilized intervention counseled caution in reliance on such 
  transactions. Against this background, nearly all the members 
  believed that the System's reciprocal currency arrangements, which 
  were a potential source of foreign currencies that might be used for 
  intervention purposes as well as an ongoing symbol of cooperation with 
  other participating central banks, should be renewed for another year.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee 
  authorized the renewal for further periods of one year of the System's 
  reciprocal currency arrangements with twelve foreign central banks and 
  the Bank for International Settlements. The amounts and existing 
  maturity dates of the arrangements are indicated in the table that 
  follows:

Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.

[SECTION]

Mr. Broaddus dissented because he believed that the Federal 
  Reserve's participation in foreign exchange market intervention 
  compromises its ability to conduct monetary policy effectively. 
  Because sterilized intervention cannot have sustained effects in the 
  absence of conforming monetary policy actions, Federal Reserve 
  participation in foreign exchange operations risks one of two 
  undesirable outcomes. First, the independence of monetary policy is 
  jeopardized if the System adjusts its policy actions to support short-term foreign exchange objectives set by the Treasury. Alternatively, 
  the credibility of monetary policy is damaged if the System does not 
  follow interventions with compatible policy actions, the interventions 
  consequently fail to achieve their objectives, and the System is 
  associated in the mind of the public with the failed operations. In 
  these circumstances, he did not view renewal of the existing swap 
  lines as desirable because they are used primarily to facilitate 
  market intervention.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 
  held on Tuesday, December 20, 1994.
