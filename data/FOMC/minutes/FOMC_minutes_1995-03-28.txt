    Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to 
    the extent necessary to carry out the Committee's foreign currency

    thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the 
    Committee may issue from time to time:

[SECTION]

A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the 
      form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the 
      open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S. 
      Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by 
      Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary 
      authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with 
      other international financial institutions:

      because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.

[SECTION]

D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies 
      not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open 
      position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding 
      signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in 
      a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that

[SECTION]

3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph 
    1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the 
    Committee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of 
    providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign 
    currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or 
    received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign 
    central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.

[SECTION]

4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central 
    banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In 
    making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System 
    holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
    shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless 
    authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or 
    understandings concerning the administration of the accounts 
    maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign 
    banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of 
    Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the 
    Committee.

[SECTION]

5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as 
    practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances. Such 
    investments shall be in liquid form, and generally have no more than

    arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency 
    holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign 
    central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities 
    within 30 calendar days.

    may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on 
    the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as 
    alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, 
    his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the 
    request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open 
    Market Account ("Manager"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or 
    contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other 
    matters relating to his responsibilities. At the request of any 
    member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and

      agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about 
      the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between 
      the System and the Treasury;

[SECTION]

PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO 
    FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS 
    Amended March 28, 1995

[SECTION]

In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and 
    direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the 
    Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency 
    Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager, 
    System Open Market Account ("Manager"), shall be guided by the 
    following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and 
    clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and 
    the Chairman of the Committee. All operations undertaken pursuant to 
    such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.

[SECTION]

1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the 
    Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the 
    Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):

[SECTION]

C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of

    developments in foreign exchange markets and on System open market 
    transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 1, 1995, 
    through March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified 
    these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Manager also reported on developments in domestic 
    financial markets and on System open market transactions in government 
    securities and federal agency obligations during the period February 
    1, 1995, through March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee 
    ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic 
    and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over 
    the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and 
    financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the 
    expansion of economic activity had moderated considerably in early 
    1995. Slower growth in consumer spending, associated in part with a 
    sharp decline in expenditures for motor vehicles, and weakness in 
    housing purchases were factors in the moderation. Despite signs of 
    some weakening in final demand, however, further sizable gains had 
    been recorded in industrial production and payroll employment, and 
    overall rates of resource utilization remained high. Broad indexes of 
    consumer and producer prices had risen more rapidly on average over 
    January and February, but wages had shown no sign of an acceleration.

[SECTION]

Nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably over 
    January and February, although the average monthly advance was 
    somewhat smaller than that of 1994. Further brisk job gains were 
    recorded in the January-February period in manufacturing; hiring in 
    retail and wholesale trade and in the service-producing sector slowed 
    a bit; and construction payrolls changed little on balance. The 
    average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers remained at a 
    high level over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate rose 
    in January but fell back in February to its December level of 5.4 
    percent.

[SECTION]

The expansion in industrial production also moderated in 
    January and February from the rapid pace of last year. Manufacturing 
    production grew less rapidly, with output gains down sharply in 
    February for consumer durable goods and construction supplies. Mining 
    production continued to be sluggish. By contrast, the output of 
    utilities surged during the January-February period as winter 
    temperatures, which had been unusually warm, moved back toward normal, 
    Capacity utilization rates, which were little changed over the first 
    two months of the year, remained high.

[SECTION]

Retail sales fell in February, reversing most of a sizable 
    rise in January. The February declines in sales were widespread, with 
    slippage evident at most types of retail outlets. Most indicators of 
    housing activity had weakened in recent months in lagged response to 
    the earlier rise in mortgage interest rates. Housing starts fell 
    sharply in January and edged still lower in February; these declines 
    more than erased the gains that had been posted on balance over the 
    closing months of 1994. A substantial drop in sales of existing homes 
    in January (latest data) extended the trend that had been evident for 
    some months.

[SECTION]

Shipments of nondefense capital goods recorded another 
    strong advance in February. Shipments of office and computing 
    equipment rebounded in February from declines in December and January, 
    and demand for most other types of equipment remained brisk. Business 
    outlays for heavy trucks fell back slightly in February after a surge 
    in January. While there were tentative signs in the recent orders 
    data of some deceleration in business equipment spending, the still-growing backlog of unfilled orders suggested further solid expansion 
    in business spending on equipment. Nonresidential construction 
    activity had been trending appreciably higher over the past two years; 
    however, a slowdown in spending by public utilities in December and 
    January, in an environment of uncertainty related to pending 
    deregulation, and a third straight monthly decline in permit issuance 
    for nonresidential structures in February pointed to some softening in 
    the uptrend.

[SECTION]

Business inventory investment surged in January after a 
    slowdown in December; excluding a large increase in stocks of motor 
    vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels, inventories rose in 
    January at about the average rate of the final three quarters of 1994. 
    In manufacturing, inventory accumulation outpaced sales in January; 
    the stocks-to-sales ratio edged higher but was still near historical 
    lows. At wholesale establishments, inventory accumulation picked up 
    in January as a large rise in automotive inventories more than offset 
    a reduced increase in stocks of other goods. The inventory-to-sales 
    ratio for the sector moved higher in January but remained well within 
    its range of the last several years. At the retail level, inventories 
    jumped in January after a slight decline in December; almost all the 
    rise reflected increased stocks of motor vehicles. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector as a whole was unchanged in January 
    and remained near the middle of its range of recent years, at 
    automotive dealerships, the inventory-to-sales ratio rose sharply 
    while elsewhere the ratio edged lower.

[SECTION]

The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
    widened sharply in January from its December level and its average 
    rate in the fourth quarter; some of the increase in the deficit was 
    due to trade with Mexico, but somewhat distorted seasonal adjustment 
    factors also may have been involved. The value of exports of goods 
    and services declined substantially in January after having increased 
    strongly in November and December. The value of imports rose 
    considerably in January, continuing the pattern of the fourth quarter. 
    The export losses and import gains in January were distributed widely 
    across major trade categories. The pace of economic recovery in the 
    major foreign industrial countries appeared to have moderated in 
    recent months. In the fourth quarter, economic activity declined in 
    Japan and grew more slowly in most of the other major industrial 
    countries; growth had picked up in Canada. Available data suggested 
    that in the first quarter economic expansion had slowed in all of the 
    major foreign industrial countries except Japan, where growth appeared 
    to be positive despite the Kobe earthquake.

Consumer price increases in January and February were a 
    little larger than the average monthly rise in 1994. Food prices were 
    unchanged on balance over the two-month period, while energy prices 
    were up only slightly. Producer prices of finished goods increased in 
    January and February at the same rate as consumer prices; producer 
    price inflation for the two months also was higher than in 1994, with 
    a steep rise in gasoline prices in January contributing to the pickup. 
    Producer prices of intermediate materials surged in the first two 
    months of this year after having accelerated sharply in the second 
    half of 1994. Average hourly earnings of private production or 
    nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in February after a substantial 
    rise in January. For the two months combined, hourly earnings 
    increased at about the same average monthly pace as in 1994.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on January 31-February 1, 1995, the Committee 
    adopted a directive that called for increasing somewhat the existing 
    degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible 
    rise of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate. The directive 
    approved by the Committee did not include a presumption about the 
    likely direction of any further adjustments to policy during the 
    intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the 
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
    sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater or 
    somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the 
    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this 
    directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 
    and M3 over coming months.

[SECTION]

On the second day of the meeting, the Board of Governors 
    approved an increase of one-half percentage point in the discount 
    rate, to 5-1/4 percent. The rise was made effective immediately and 
    was passed through fully to interest rates in reserve markets. Open 
    market operations during the intermeeting period were conducted with a 
    view to maintaining the tighter policy stance adopted at the meeting 
    and implemented immediately thereafter. The federal funds rate 
    averaged a little less than 6 percent over the intermeeting interval, 
    and adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was a little below anticipated 
    levels.

[SECTION]

Financial market participants generally had expected a 
    firming in reserve market conditions, and consequently market interest 
    rates showed little immediate reaction. Subsequently, most market 
    interest rates declined considerably in response to both incoming data 
    that were seen as indicating an appreciable slowing in the pace of 
    economic expansion and statements by Federal Reserve officials that 
    were viewed as suggesting that the period of monetary policy 
    tightening might be coming to a close. The largest declines in yields 
    were concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. 
    Stronger-than-expected earnings reports coupled with heightened 
    prospects for sustained, moderate economic expansion and continued low 
    inflation boosted major indexes of equity prices to record levels.

[SECTION]

In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell substantially 
    further. The dollar's decline was particularly sharp against the 
    Japanese yen and the German mark, and post-World War II record lows 
    against these two currencies were recorded. Declines in U.S. interest 
    rates and concerns about the persistence of large U.S. trade and 
    fiscal deficits appeared to have contributed to the dollar's drop. 
    Continuing economic and financial problems in Mexico, which resulted 
    in further depreciation on balance of the Mexican peso against the 
    dollar, also seemed to add to negative sentiment toward the dollar 
    because the process of adjustment in the Mexican economy to the lower 
    value of the peso was viewed as implying reduced imports from and 
    increased exports to the United States.

[SECTION]

M2 declined, and growth of M3 slowed in February after 
    sizable January gains; data for the first part of March pointed to 
    some recovery in both aggregates. M2's weakness in February partly 
    reflected an unwinding of temporary increases in January of its 
    volatile components, including demand deposits, overnight repurchase 
    agreements, and overnight Eurodollars; the weakness also appeared to 
    be associated with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by 
    shifting funds into market instruments. The slowdown in growth of M3 
    in February was entirely attributable to the decline in M2; its non-M2 
    component increased substantially further as banks continued to rely 
    heavily on managed liabilities to fund loan growth. Expansion of 
    total domestic nonfinancial debt had picked up a little in recent 
    months.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
    growth of economic activity was slowing and for some period ahead 
    would average a little less than the rate of increase in the economy's 
    potential output. The pace of the expansion seemed to have slackened 
    somewhat more than had been anticipated at the last meeting; however, 
    the recent declines in long-term interest rates and the rally in stock 
    prices were expected to provide additional support for aggregate 
    demand later in the year. Moreover, the substantial depreciation of 
    the dollar against the yen and several European currencies was acting 
    to offset some of the effects on demand of the previous tightening of 
    reserve conditions. The forecast continued to anticipate that in the 
    period ahead consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in 
    real incomes, the substantial degree to which pent-up demands had been 
    satisfied, and the lagged effects of earlier increases in interest 
    rates on the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new 
    equipment would decelerate substantially in response to slower growth 
    of sales and profits. Homebuilding was projected to decline somewhat 
    further in the near term and to remain at somewhat subdued levels for 
    a time in reflection of the damping effects on housing demand of 
    slower growth in jobs and incomes and of the earlier rise in mortgage 
    rates. Developments in Mexico were likely to interrupt only briefly a 
    strong uptrend in U.S. exports, based on sustained growth in the 
    economies of other U.S. trading partners. Considerable uncertainty 
    continued to surround the federal fiscal outlook but, as in the 
    previous forecast, a moderate pace of deficit reduction was assumed 
    over the forecast horizon. In the staff's judgment, the economy was 
    operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary capacity, and there 
    remained a risk that higher inflation could emerge if the expansion 
    did not moderate sufficiently.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    economic developments, the members agreed that the pace of the 
    economic expansion was moderating, though the extent of the slowdown 
    was not yet clear. The effects of the policy tightening implemented 
    since early 1994 seemed to be showing through in interest-sensitive 
    sectors, and those effects were expected to be reinforced by some 
    cutback in inventory accumulation from the unsustainable rates of 
    previous quarters. Quarters of fairly slow growth were not unusual in 
    a period of expansion. On the whole, however, the economy appeared to 
    retain considerable forward momentum, with current imbalances 
    seemingly of a relatively minor nature and in the process of being 
    corrected. Moreover, the recent declines in long-term interest rates, 
    if these persisted, could provide fresh support for interest-sensitive 
    spending later in 1995 and in 1996. While opinions differed somewhat 
    with respect to both the likely extent of the slowdown and the 
    prognosis for inflation, the members generally agreed that the economy 
    appeared to be on a trajectory toward a more sustainable path for 
    economic activity. However, a number of members expressed concern 
    that the slowdown might not be sufficient to relieve the persisting 
    pressures on labor and capital resources, thereby portending higher 
    inflation.

[SECTION]

In the course of the Committee's discussion, members 
    reported on widespread signs that business activity, while still quite 
    strong in many areas, was growing less rapidly on balance. Still, a 
    number of factors pointed to continued solid expansion. Business 
    sentiment was generally described as quite positive, though somewhat 
    less ebullient than in earlier months. Likewise, recent surveys 
    suggested that consumer confidence remained very favorable, though 
    down slightly from recent peaks by most measures. In addition to the 
    favorable recent developments in financial markets, bank lending 
    policies remained quite accommodative, although business loan growth 
    had slowed recently after a period of unusual strength.

[SECTION]

In their review of developments in key sectors of the 
    economy, members took note of the sluggishness in consumer spending 
    that had emerged in recent months in much of the country. To a 
    considerable extent the recent weakness reflected a sharp reduction in 
    spending for motor vehicles, but there also were signs in the most 
    recent data of broader declines in spending, especially for durable 
    goods other than automobiles. Some reduction in spending for durable 
    goods could be expected in lagged response to the policy tightening 
    over the past year, but a few members noted that unusual weather might 
    have led to the temporary postponement of some discretionary 
    purchases. In assessing the recent spending patterns, it was 
    difficult to determine whether they represented a temporary pause or a 
    more prolonged pullback by consumers. On balance, however, growth in 
    consumer spending probably would slow somewhat further to a rate more 
    in line with the expansion in jobs and incomes. Consumer spending 
    would tend to be sustained, however, by the ready availability of 
    consumer financing and the rise in bond and stock prices, which had 
    strengthened household balance sheets and perhaps was helping to 
    bolster consumer confidence.

[SECTION]

The housing market had weakened noticeably according to 
    incoming data and anecdotal reports from around the country. The 
    decline in home sales that began in the latter part of 1994 had 
    persisted, and housing starts had fallen sharply in the early part of 
    the year as a consequence of the weaker sales and a larger inventory 
    of unsold homes. Partly because of the higher mortgage rates that had 
    prevailed for some time, members anticipated still soft housing 
    demand, particularly for single-family houses. There had been some 
    reports that recent declines in mortgage interest rates were having a 
    mitigating effect. In some parts of the country, the weakness in 
    housing construction was being countered by further improvement in 
    nonresidential construction activity. In other areas where commercial 
    real estate conditions remained soft, declines in vacancy rates seemed 
    to be preparing the way for a pickup in commercial building activity.

[SECTION]

Committee members anticipated that growth of business 
    investment in plant and equipment would moderate from the 
    extraordinary rate of the last two years but that such investment 
    would continue to support growth in aggregate final demand during the 
    forecast period. The demand for durable equipment was expected to 
    increase more gradually as the growth of economic activity slowed and 
    business profits tended to flatten out, and the available data on 
    equipment expenditures thus far in 1995 appeared to be in line with 
    that expectation. However, some anecdotal reports suggested that 
    investment in plant and equipment might be stronger than expected in 
    an environment of tight labor supply and elevated levels of capacity 
    utilization, intense desires to control costs and improve 
    competitiveness, and a still relatively low user cost of capital. The 
    desire for additional production capacity was reflected in spending 
    for the construction of commercial and industrial structures, which 
    remained on an uptrend.

[SECTION]

The rapid rise in business inventories in recent quarters 
    had been sustainable in the context of briskly increasing final sales, 
    but with some further accumulation early in the first quarter and 
    economic growth projected to moderate, the rate of inventory 
    investment would have to adjust downward as well. While the timing 
    and extent could not be anticipated with any precision, a short-term 
    inventory correction process might already be under way, with firms 
    initiating cutbacks to production schedules to reflect smaller-than-expected gains in sales over recent months. Members noted that 
    inventory-to-sales ratios already were at generally low levels and 
    they anticipated that any desired adjustments to production would be 
    made quickly. In the circumstances, the size of the inventory 
    correction and its effect on economic activity would be limited. 
    Moreover, reports of inventory shortages in some industries suggested 
    that many firms might raise their desired inventory levels to protect 
    against shortfalls in materials needed in the production process.

[SECTION]

The defeat of the balanced budget amendment in Congress had 
    clouded the outlook for deficit reduction. Nonetheless, a moderately 
    restrictive fiscal policy that would provide for some progress toward 
    a balanced budget during the forecast period was seen as a reasonable 
    assumption. One member observed that there was a risk of a more 
    restrictive fiscal policy arising out of the dynamics of the current 
    political debate. In any event, any progress toward a balanced budget 
    might be expected to have a favorable effect on domestic financial 
    markets and perhaps also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets.

[SECTION]

Members commented that considerable uncertainty surrounded 
    the outlook for the external sector, but for now it seemed reasonable 
    to forecast that this sector would make a small positive contribution, 
    on balance, to the growth of economic activity over the forecast 
    period. In the near term, economic developments in Mexico were 
    leading to lower U.S. exports and higher imports; anecdotal reports 
    suggested that the effects on trade flows and local business activity 
    tended to be felt most strongly in states that border Mexico. 
    However, there were signs that conditions were stabilizing in Mexico, 
    and more generally the relatively robust growth projected for the 
    major trading partners of the United States and the lower value of the 
    dollar now prevailing were expected to foster improvement in the 
    nation's trade balance.

[SECTION]

Members noted that while the pace of the expansion evidently 
    had slowed, economic activity and utilization of labor and other 
    producer resources were still at very high levels. Prices of many 
    materials inputs to the production process had risen sharply, but thus 
    far there had been only a small pickup in consumer prices. Likewise, 
    the persisting tightness in many labor markets had not to this point 
    fostered appreciable increases in wages. The absence of a significant 
    rise in prices of finished goods or in wages might reflect in some 
    measure the lags in the inflation transmission process, the fruits of 
    heavy business investments in new capacity and more productive 
    equipment in recent years, and perhaps structural changes in business 
    organization that were raising the economy's capacity for sustained, 
    noninflationary activity. Members were concerned, however, that 
    despite continuing competitive pressures and some recent abatement in 
    materials prices, business firms were reporting greater success in 
    passing cost increases through to prices. The depreciation of the 
    dollar also would add to inflationary pressures in the economy. In 
    these circumstances, the members generally concluded that some 
    increase in inflation was likely in coming months.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the 
    intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to 
    maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The 
    policy tightening that had been implemented since early 1994 appeared 
    to be exerting a desired restraining effect on the growth of economic 
    activity and associated demands for goods and services. But the 
    extent of the slowing in growth and its effects on inflationary 
    pressures were not yet clear. On balance, though, the available 
    evidence tended to suggest that the economy might be moving toward a 
    growth path for economic activity that would be consistent with 
    limiting the uptick in inflation that was currently being experienced. 
    In discussing their policy choices, several members noted the 
    relatively steep decline in the value of the dollar. However, they 
    believed that policy should not be directed toward the achievement of 
    a specific level for the dollar but rather toward the implementation 
    of an effective anti-inflationary monetary policy, taking account of 
    all the factors bearing on the economic outlook. In current 
    circumstances, and given the substantial uncertainties that were 
    involved, the members believed that it would be prudent to pause and 
    assess developments before taking any further policy action.

[SECTION]

With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the 
    intermeeting period, most members expressed a preference for an 
    asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. These members indicated 
    that near-term developments were not likely to call for an adjustment 
    to policy in either direction. Nonetheless, with the economy expected 
    to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential, the recent rise 
    in inflation and the risk of an unexpected impulse that could ratchet 
    inflation even higher suggested that an asymmetric directive would be 
    more consistent with the Committee's objective of moving over time 
    toward price stability. The economy retained considerable forward 
    momentum and, as had often happened in the past, the recent slowdown 
    in growth could prove to be temporary, with additional monetary 
    tightening needed at some point to contain inflation. In this 
    connection a few members indicated that further tightening might well 
    be needed sooner rather than later. An asymmetric directive also 
    would provide a clear signal of the Committee's intention to resist 
    higher inflation.

[SECTION]

A few members preferred a symmetric directive. These 
    members agreed that additional policy tightening might be needed if 
    inflation began to pick up. However, they saw an undesirably weaker 
    economic performance as being about equally likely, and in their view 
    this balance in the risks to the outlook called for the adoption of a 
    symmetric directive. The Committee's determination to keep inflation 
    under control would be appropriately conveyed, in their view, through 
    future actions rather than through the adoption of a tilt toward 
    restraint. However, these members indicated that they could accept an 
    asymmetric intermeeting instruction.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members indicated that they preferred or could support a directive 
    that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of 
    reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in 
    the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability 
    and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
    economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided 
    that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and 
    slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 
    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this 
    meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and 
    M3 over coming months.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank 
    of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that the expansion of economic activity has moderated 
      considerably in early 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment 
      rose appreciably further in January and February, but 
      at a pace below the average monthly gain in 1994; the 
      civilian unemployment rate, after rising in January, 
      fell back in February to its December level of 5.4 
      percent. Advances in industrial production also 
      moderated in January and February, and capacity 
      utilization rates generally changed little from already 
      high levels. Total retail sales were about unchanged 
      over the two months. Housing starts have declined 
      somewhat after posting sizable gains on balance during 
      the closing months of 1994. Orders for nondefense 
      capital goods point to a still strong expansion of 
      spending on business equipment, but with tentative 
      signs of some deceleration; nonresidential construction 
      has been trending appreciably higher. The nominal 
      deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened 
      sharply in January from its average rate in the fourth 
      quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices 
      increased faster on average over January and February.

[SECTION]

On February 1, 1995, the Board of Governors 
      approved an increase from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the 
      discount rate, and in keeping with the Committee's 
      decision at the January 31-February 1 meeting, the 
      increase was allowed to show through fully to interest 
      rates in reserve markets. Nonetheless, most market 
      interest rates have declined somewhat since the 
      Committee meeting; the largest declines have been 
      concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted 
      value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 
      currencies was down substantially further over the 
      intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has continued to 
      depreciate against the dollar.

[SECTION]

M2 and M3 weakened in February, though data for 
      the first part of March pointed to some rebound. 
      Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt has picked 
      up a little in recent months.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for 
      growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 
      percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee 
      anticipated that money growth within these ranges would 
      be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The 
      monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will 
      continue to be evaluated in the light of progress 
      toward price level stability, movements in their 
      velocities, and developments in the economy and 
      financial markets.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve 
      restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
      might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.
