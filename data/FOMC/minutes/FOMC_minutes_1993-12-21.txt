1. Attended part of the meeting.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the minutes for the meeting of the 
  Federal Open Market Committee held on November 16, 1993, were 
  approved.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, responsibility for making decisions on 
  appeals of denials by the Secretary of the Committee for access to 
  Committee records was delegated under the provisions of 271.4(d) of 
  the Committee's Rules regarding Availability of Information to Mr. 
  Mullins and, in his absence, to Ms. Phillips.

[SECTION]

The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments 
  in foreign exchange markets during the period since the November 
  meeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign 
  currencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the 
  Committee.

[SECTION]

The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments 
  in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions 
  in government securities and federal agency obligations during the 
  period November 16, 1993, through December 20, 1993. By unanimous 
  vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic 
  and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over 
  the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and 
  financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
  Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
  policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that 
  economic activity had recorded a strong advance in recent months. 
  Consumer spending had picked up, and business purchases of durable 
  equipment had remained on a marked upward trend. Residential 
  construction was rising rapidly, and nonresidential construction had 
  turned up from depressed levels. Industrial production had been 
  boosted by developments in the motor vehicle industry, and employment 
  had continued to post solid gains. Most indexes of prices pointed to 
  little change in inflation trends despite the recent acceleration of 
  economic activity.

[SECTION]

Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably further in 
  November. Another substantial increase in jobs was recorded in the 
  services industries, notably in health and business services. 
  Construction employment was up significantly further after registering 
  modest gains on balance over the first three quarters of 1993. In 
  manufacturing, there were back-to-back increases in jobs in October 
  and November following seven consecutive monthly declines, and both 
  overtime hours and the average workweek remained at a high level. 
  Most of the November expansion in factory jobs occurred in the motor 
  vehicle and capital goods industries. The civilian unemployment rate 
  fell considerably in November, to 6.4 percent.

[SECTION]

Industrial production increased sharply in October and 
  November. Manufacturing accounted for all the gain over the two 
  months, with the rise partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the 
  production of motor vehicles and parts. Elsewhere in manufacturing, 
  strong advances were recorded in the output of computers and non-auto 
  durable consumer goods. The sharp expansion in production was 
  associated with substantial increases in the rate of utilization of 
  industrial capacity in October and November.

[SECTION]

Retail sales were up moderately in November after a large 
  advance in October. Motor vehicle sales surged in October and 
  remained at the higher level in November, apparently reflecting in 
  part favorable financing terms, small price increases--adjusted for 
  quality improvements--on 1994 models, and generous incentives on 
  pickup trucks from some manufacturers. Sales of apparel, furniture 
  and appliances, and other durable goods also were strong on balance 
  over October and November. Housing starts rose substantially in 
  November; starts of single-family units reached their highest level 
  since early 1987, but starts of multifamily units edged lower. Sales 
  of both new and existing homes remained robust in October.

[SECTION]

Business spending for durable equipment apparently continued 
  to rise rapidly. Among nondefense capital goods other than aircraft, 
  shipments of computers and other durable equipment were significantly 
  higher in October than in the third quarter. In addition, the demand 
  for heavy trucks remained strong, and the brisk sales of light 
  vehicles in October and November likely were the result in part of a 
  step-up in spending by businesses. Nonresidential construction 
  activity increased again in October: Office building declined further 
  and industrial construction retraced part of a sizable September gain, 
  but outlays for institutional, public utilities, and non-office 
  commercial structures continued to move higher.

[SECTION]

Business inventories were little changed in October, with 
  reductions in manufacturing and wholesale stocks nearly offsetting 
  increases at the retail level. A moderate further decline in 
  manufacturers' inventories in October was concentrated among producers 
  of aircraft and parts, where stocks have been contracting for more 
  than two years; the stocks-to-shipments ratio for manufacturing as a 
  whole fell to its lowest level in recent years. In the wholesale 
  sector, inventories declined in October after changing little in 
  September, and the ratio of inventories to sales remained in the 
  middle of its range over the past several years. At the retail level, 
  stocks increased considerably further; with sales expanding 
  vigorously, however, the ratio of stocks to sales edged lower and this 
  ratio also was in the middle of its range over the past several years.

[SECTION]

The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit for October was 
  about unchanged from its September level and its average rate for the 
  third quarter. The value of both exports and imports increased in 
  October. Exports of automotive products rose strongly, and exports of 
  aircraft rebounded from a September downturn. The advance in imports 
  was spread across all major categories. Economic activity in the 
  major foreign industrial countries expanded moderately in the third 
  quarter; however, available data suggested that output in Japan and 
  Germany might decline in the current quarter, with a depressing effect 
  on growth for these industrial countries as a group.

[SECTION]

Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices pointed to 
  little change in inflation trends, although prices of some commodities 
  and industrial materials had firmed recently. Producer prices of 
  finished goods were unchanged in November after declining in October 
  and over the third quarter. In November, a large drop in the prices 
  of finished energy goods offset a rebound in the prices of other 
  finished goods. Producer prices for nonfood, non-energy finished 
  goods were about unchanged over the twelve months ended in November. 
  At the consumer level, prices of items other than food and energy 
  advanced moderately in November; the twelve-month increase in this 
  price measure was a little smaller than the rise over the comparable 
  period ended in November 1992. Average hourly earnings edged up in 
  November; for the twelve months ended in November, these earnings were 
  up by a smaller amount than over the preceding year.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on November 16, 1993, the Committee adopted a 
  directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
  on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the 
  likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting 
  period. Accordingly, the directive indicated that in the context of 
  the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and 
  sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to 
  economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater or 
  slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 
  intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this 
  directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of M2 and 
  M3 over coming months.

[SECTION]

Open market operations during the intermeeting period were 
  directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
  positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat less 
  than anticipated levels, reflecting very light amounts of adjustment 
  borrowing over most of the period, and the federal funds rate remained 
  close to 3 percent.

[SECTION]

While most short-term interest rates changed little over the 
  intermeeting period, signs of stronger economic growth and the firming 
  of some commodity prices tended to push up longer-term interest rates, 
  although that pressure was offset to some extent by declines in oil 
  prices. Taken as a whole, incoming economic data were seen by market 
  participants as increasing the odds of a tightening of monetary policy 
  at some point but not necessarily in the very near term. Most 
  indexes of stock prices fell slightly over the intermeeting period, 
  but the strong performance of a few firms boosted the Dow Jones 
  Industrial Average to a new high near the end of the period.

[SECTION]

In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
  dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on 
  balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated against 
  the yen in response to incoming data suggesting weakness in the 
  Japanese economy and heightened prospects for further monetary easing 
  by the Bank of Japan. Even though interest rates eased in Europe as 
  central banks lowered their money-market intervention rates, the 
  dollar was little changed against the German mark and declined 
  somewhat against other European currencies.

[SECTION]

Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened appreciably in November; 
  both aggregates had risen at somewhat faster rates since late summer 
  than earlier in the year. Ml growth remained brisk in November, and 
  money funds included in M2 apparently benefited from a slowdown in 
  inflows to bond funds in the wake of the earlier decline in bond 
  prices. The pickup in M3 growth reflected a surge in term Eurodollar 
  deposits as well as faster growth of M2. For the year through 
  November, M2 and M3 were estimated to have grown at rates somewhat 
  above the lower end of the Committee's ranges for the year. Total 
  domestic nonfinancial debt had expanded moderately in recent months, 
  and for the year through November it was estimated to have increased 
  at a rate in the lower half of the Committee's monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that, 
  after a strong fourth-quarter advance, the economy would expand at a 
  more moderate rate in 1994. Consumer spending was projected to 
  decelerate to a rate more in line with the growth of disposable 
  income. Business fixed investment was expected to advance briskly, 
  although not quite as rapidly as in 1993, and further gains in 
  homebuilding activity likely would be concentrated in the first half 
  of the year. Exports were projected to strengthen somewhat, bolstered 
  by a modest pickup in foreign economic growth. Fiscal restraint was 
  expected to exert a substantial drag on spending, through both falling 
  government defense purchases and higher taxes. In light of the 
  limited margins of slack in labor and product markets, the ongoing 
  expansion was projected to be associated with only a slight further 
  reduction in inflation.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
  economic developments, members referred to widespread indications, 
  both statistical and anecdotal, of a marked strengthening in economic 
  activity and much improved business and consumer confidence in recent 
  months. The rate of economic growth could be expected to moderate 
  during the early months of 1994 from what currently appeared to be an 
  unsustainable pace, but the members viewed the extent of such 
  moderation as a key uncertainty in the outlook. A number of members 
  observed that a sharp slowing of the expansion early next year, 
  similar to the slowdown after the surge in activity during the closing 
  months of 1992, could not be ruled out. However, most saw the gains 
  in the economy as more solidly based than earlier in the expansion, 
  and they generally expected the economy to settle into a pattern of 
  moderate growth over coming quarters at a trend rate close to or 
  somewhat above the economy's long-run potential. With regard to the 
  outlook for inflation, the members saw little evidence in available 
  measures of prices and wages or in other indicators that any 
  significant change might already have occurred in underlying inflation 
  trends. Nonetheless, views varied somewhat with regard to the outlook 
  and ranged from expectations of some modest further decline in the 
  core rate of inflation to concerns about the possibility of some 
  acceleration in the context of diminishing margins of unemployed 
  production resources and an accommodative monetary policy as reflected 
  in low real short-term interest rates and continued rapid growth in 
  narrow measures of money and reserves.

[SECTION]

In their comments about developments across the nation, 
  members observed that economic conditions clearly had strengthened in 
  many regions and that the better conditions had fostered appreciable 
  improvement in business and consumer sentiment in most parts of the 
  country. The members recognized that the economic expansion was still 
  quite subdued in many local areas and that economic activity remained 
  depressed in some parts of the country such as southern California. 
  The overall strength of the economy was fueled to an important extent 
  by interest-sensitive spending on producer and consumer durables and 
  housing and tended to confirm the durability of the expansion. 
  Gains in such spending were not likely to be sustained at their recent 
  rates, but the cash flow and income that such expenditures had 
  generated were likely to foster further economic growth, especially in 
  the context of generally supportive conditions in financial and credit 
  markets. The members acknowledged that a number of factors continued 
  to constrain the expansion, including ongoing though less pervasive 
  balance-sheet rebuilding, business restructuring and downsizing 
  activities, and the downtrend in defense spending. On balance, 
  however, current developments did not point to a marked deviation from 
  the moderate growth trend in economic activity that had been 
  experienced over the past two years, though in the view of a number of 
  members the odds on somewhat stronger growth were greater than they 
  had been earlier in the expansion.

[SECTION]

With regard to the outlook for key sectors of the economy, 
  consumer expenditures were seen as likely to continue to provide vital 
  support to the expansion even though increases in consumer spending 
  were not likely to be maintained at recent rates. Members noted that 
  the improved consumer confidence and increased spending were reflected 
  in a somewhat greater willingness to incur debt, at least in the 
  context of reduced interest rates. Some members cautioned, however, 
  that growth in consumer expenditures had exceeded gains in incomes for 
  an extended period, insofar as could be judged from available data, 
  and an already low saving rate seemed likely to limit the potential 
  growth in such spending. Moreover, the negative impact of increased 
  tax rates on high incomes seemed likely to be felt especially during 
  the first half of 1994, though the extent of that impact on consumer 
  spending remained uncertain. On the positive side, members cited a 
  number of developments that would tend to bolster overall consumer 
  expenditures, including lower energy costs, reduced income taxes for 
  many individuals stemming from indexing, and lower interest charges on 
  various kinds of debt. More generally, the rise in consumer 
  confidence seemed to be related to perceptions of improving employment 
  opportunities despite continuing announcements of sizable workforce 
  reductions by some large firms.

[SECTION]

The members expected growth in real business investment to 
  remain robust in 1994 but to decelerate somewhat from the rapid rate 
  of expansion over the past year. Continuing increases in business 
  sales and low financing costs along with ongoing efforts to improve 
  productivity were likely to remain conducive to substantial further 
  growth in overall spending for business equipment despite persisting 
  weakness in aerospace and defense-related industries. Nonresidential 
  construction activity, including commercial and industrial building 
  and infrastructure construction, displayed signs of considerable 
  strength in some parts of the country; and declining vacancy rates 
  pointed to a leveling out or even a pickup in nonresidential building 
  construction in a number of other areas. Some expansion in inventories seemed likely over the forecast horizon to accommodate the 
  continuing growth in overall demands. In this connection, members 
  noted that a rise in inventories probably contributed to the expansion 
  in production in recent months since the latter could not be explained 
  entirely by the strength of final demand, and a buildup of motor 
  vehicle stocks in late 1993 was likely to continue into the early part 
  of 1994.

[SECTION]

The housing sector was expected to remain a source of 
  considerable economic stimulus during the early months of 1994, both 
  directly and indirectly in terms of the favorable effects on purchases 
  of home furnishings. Some members commented that the increases in 
  housing starts experienced over the closing months of this year might 
  not be sustainable; even so, housing construction, especially in the 
  single-family sector, should be relatively well maintained given the 
  likelihood that home ownership would remain comparatively affordable 
  in the context of growing incomes, favorable mortgage rates, and 
  limited pressures on the prices of new homes.

[SECTION]

With respect to fiscal policy, members referred to the 
  prospects for further cutbacks in defense spending that probably would 
  continue to be offset only in part by growth in federal government 
  purchases of other goods and services. However, net reductions in 
  government purchases were expected to diminish over the projection 
  horizon. Likewise, adverse effects on spending of the rise in tax 
  rates on higher incomes would tend to be concentrated in the first 
  half of 1994, and the impact on spending over the months ahead might 
  well be relatively limited because many taxpayers probably had 
  anticipated the higher taxes and had taken measures to mitigate or 
  spread out their effects or would meet new tax obligations partly out 
  of savings. Proposed health care reform legislation would exert a 
  restraining effect on the economy, should it be enacted, owing to 
  mandated cost increases on employers. If this form of financing were 
  adopted, however, the legislation might have little, or perhaps even a 
  favorable, effect on the federal deficit.

[SECTION]

The external sector of the economy also appeared likely to 
  have a moderating effect on domestic economic activity over the year 
  ahead. The economies of key foreign industrial nations and thus U.S. 
  exports to those nations were projected to grow only gradually, while 
  the expansion of U.S. imports was likely to remain relatively robust 
  on the basis of current expectations for domestic economic activity. 
  In the view of at least some members, however, stimulative economic 
  policies in a number of foreign countries might well lead to stronger 
  economic performances and to greater demand for U.S. goods and 
  services than many observers currently anticipated. In any event, the 
  members generally agreed that the outlook for developments abroad 
  remained a source of particular uncertainty for the domestic economy.

[SECTION]

Members commented that there were few indications of any 
  change in inflationary trends in broad measures of prices and wages 
  despite the surge in economic activity in recent months and associated 
  increases in capacity utilization rates. One important sign of 
  growing inflationary pressures, rising lead times for deliveries of 
  materials, had not emerged. Some members noted that while capacity 
  usage rates were approaching or had reached levels that in the past 
  had tended to signal the onset of rising inflation, the growth of 
  competition stemming from the internationalization of numerous markets 
  suggested that old capacity benchmarks might no longer apply and, 
  especially in the context of excess capacity in many foreign 
  economies, the potential inflationary effects of strong domestic 
  demand pressures might remain subdued for some period of time. In 
  keeping with these assessments, members again reported on the absence 
  of inflationary cost pressures in local areas across the country and 
  on persisting comments by business contacts regarding their inability 
  to raise prices to achieve more satisfactory or customary profit 
  margins. Business executives continued to look to improvements in 
  productivity to maintain or increase their margins, and there were 
  numerous reports of considerable success in implementing productivity 
  gains. Price developments in commodity markets presented a mixed 
  picture; higher food prices stemming from weather conditions earlier 
  in the year had had an adverse effect on broad measures of prices, but 
  the drop in energy prices had favorable implications for the near-term 
  inflation outlook.

[SECTION]

It also was noted that rising inflationary pressures often 
  were accompanied by a pickup in credit demands, and there was no 
  evidence of any surge in such demands. However, the expansion of 
  overall nonfinancial debt had strengthened to a degree. Moreover, in 
  the view of some members, the rise in long-term interest rates and in 
  gold prices might well have been caused in part by heightened 
  inflation concerns. Members also cited scattered examples of greater 
  price pressures, notably the prices of lumber and some other building 
  materials and of related efforts to pass on the added costs through 
  higher prices on new homes in some areas. Despite the absence of any 
  general indication of rising inflation, a number of members expressed 
  concern about the potential for increasing inflationary pressures in 
  the economy and saw a need to monitor possible future sources of 
  inflation with special care over the period ahead, especially in light 
  of the considerable lags between monetary policy actions and their 
  effects on prices.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of monetary policy for the 
  period until the next scheduled meeting in early February, a majority 
  of the members endorsed a proposal to maintain unchanged conditions in 
  reserve markets and to retain the currently unbiased instruction in 
  the directive concerning possible intermeeting adjustments to policy. 
  Looking forward, many of the members commented that the Committee 
  probably would have to firm reserve conditions at some point to adjust 
  monetary policy from its currently quite accommodative stance to a 
  more neutral position, and that such a policy move might have to be 
  made sooner rather than later to contain inflation and continue to 
  provide a sound basis for sustained economic expansion. Monetary 
  conditions had been eased to their current degree of accommodation in 
  the 1990-1992 period in the context of balance-sheet restructuring and 
  other unusual forces that were holding down spending. Since the 
  latter part of 1992, however, downside risks to the expansion had 
  diminished considerably as financial conditions became more supportive 
  of economic activity. Borrowers and lenders had strengthened their 
  financial positions substantially and were less reluctant to use and 
  extend credit. Moreover, the low level of real short-term interest 
  rates and in the view of some members the continued rapid growth of 
  reserves or increases in a variety of commodity prices provided 
  evidence of a quite accommodative monetary policy. Overstaying such a 
  policy would incur an increasing risk of fostering greater inflationary pressures that in turn would undermine the sustainablity of the 
  expansion. For now, however, a majority believed that the risks 
  remained at an acceptable level, given the remaining slack in the 
  economy and the lack of near-term inflation pressures. Waiting for 
  further developments before making any policy move was warranted in 
  light of the uncertainties surrounding the outlook, notably with 
  regard to the extent of the moderation in economic growth expected 
  early next year. If the economy settled into a pattern of growth 
  about in line with its potential, the chances of greater inflation 
  pressures down the road would be reduced and the need for a near-term 
  policy adjustment would be less pressing, though it would still be 
  required at some point.

[SECTION]

Two members expressed a strong preference for a prompt move 
  toward a firmer policy stance to forestall inflation pressures. A 
  number of others commented that the decision was a close call, 
  including two who had a marginal preference for tightening policy at 
  this time but who could accept a delay in light of the uncertainties 
  that were involved.

[SECTION]

Members who could support an unchanged policy stance also 
  indicated their acceptance of a directive that was not biased in 
  either direction with regard to possible adjustments in the degree of 
  reserve pressure during the intermeeting period. Some observed that 
  while the flow of economic reports during this period was likely to 
  underscore the marked strengthening of the economy, those reports 
  mainly would cover developments in the fourth quarter, and from a 
  monetary policy perspective the members were more interested in 
  knowing something about the extent of the follow-through strength 
  early in the new year. Moreover, the members recognized that any 
  tightening move would represent a turn in policy that might well have 
  a greater-than-usual effect on financial markets. This prospect 
  argued for taking such an action at a meeting, with the benefit of a 
  full Committee review of the implications for future growth and 
  inflation pressures of a wide variety of emerging developments--including those in money, credit, and financial markets--rather than 
  an intermeeting action based on an asymmetric directive. In the view 
  of one member, a tightening action over the coming intermeeting period 
  would incur an undue risk of an exaggerated response in financial 
  markets, given the likelihood of thin trading markets around year-end; 
  and since a policy move should be postponed, a symmetrical directive 
  seemed appropriate.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but two 
  of the members indicated that they could support a directive that 
  called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
  positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely 
  direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. 
  Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
  price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful 
  consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the 
  Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve 
  restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. 
  According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at 
  this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 
  over the months ahead.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank 
  of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
  the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
  accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    a strong advance in economic activity in recent months. 
    Total nonfarm payroll employment rose appreciably 
    further in November, and the civilian unemployment rate 
    fell considerably to 6.4 percent. Industrial 
    production increased sharply in October and November, 
    partly reflecting a continuing rebound in the output of 
    motor vehicles. Retail sales were up moderately in 
    November after, a large increase in October. Housing 
    starts advanced substantially in November. Business 
    equipment expenditures have been rising rapidly, and 
    nonresidential construction has turned up from 
    depressed levels. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade 
    deficit in October was about unchanged from its average 
    rate in the third quarter. Broad indexes of consumer 
    and producer prices suggest little change in inflation 
    trends, although prices of some raw materials have 
    increased recently.

[SECTION]

Short-term interest rates have changed little, 
    while intermediate- and long-term rates have risen 
    slightly since the Committee meeting on November 16. 
    In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value 
    of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies is 
    about unchanged on balance over the intermeeting 
    period.

[SECTION]

Growth of M2 and M3 strengthened in November, and 
    both aggregates have risen at somewhat faster rates 
    since late summer than earlier in the year. For the 
    year through November, M2 and M3 are estimated to have 
    grown at rates somewhat above the lower end of the 
    Committee's ranges for the year. Total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in 
    recent months, and for the year through November it is 
    estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half 
    of the Committee's monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
    meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established 
    in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 
    percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
    the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
    1993. The Committee anticipated that developments 
    contributing to unusual velocity increases would 
    persist over the balance of the year and that money 
    growth within these lower ranges would be consistent 
    with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range 
    for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was 
    lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the 
    Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary 
    growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
    fourth quarter of 1994, of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 
    0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set 
    the monitoring range for growth of total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The 
    behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be 
    evaluated in the light of progress toward price level 
    stability, movements in their velocities, and 
    developments in the economy and financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
    future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
    degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
    context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
    giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
    and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
    restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
    acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent 
    with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, 
    McDonough, Boehne, Keehn, Kelley, LaWare, McTeer, 
    Mullins, Ms. Phillips, and Mr. Stern.

[SECTION]

Votes against this action: Messrs. Angell 
    and Lindsey.

[SECTION]

Messrs. Angell and Lindsey dissented because they believed 
  that monetary policy was overly accommodative and needed to be 
  adjusted promptly toward a more neutral stance to counter potential 
  inflationary pressures in the economy. They referred to the long lags 
  with which monetary policy exerts its effects on inflation and the 
  consequent need to adjust monetary policy on a timely basis to foster 
  the Committee's long-run objective of stable prices. They understood 
  the difficulty of finding the appropriate circumstances for tightening 
  actions so as to avoid unintended interpretations and repercussions in 
  financial markets. In their judgment, economic and financial conditions were unlikely to be more favorable later and waiting risked 
  undesirable inflationary consequences.

[SECTION]

Mr. Angell also stressed that the Committee should focus more 
  directly on forward-looking indicators such as the price of gold and 
  the estimate of the natural rate of interest provided by the rate on 
  five-year Treasury notes. He favored an immediate increase of 50 
  basis points in the federal funds rate, which would enable the 
  Committee to observe how the market adjusted the price of gold to the 
  changed opportunity cost of holding gold. He believed that if bond 
  market participants concluded that the Committee was using the price 
  of gold to target the price level, five-year and ten-year interest 
  rates would then be significantly lower than if the Committee's 
  tightening was a belated response to a worsening outlook for 
  inflation. He emphasized that the objective of monetary policy 
  clearly should be stable money which produces stable prices and an 
  ongoing optimal and stable economic growth path.

[SECTION]

Mr. Lindsey commented further that a modest policy move now 
  would appropriately signal the Committee's concern about the potential 
  for inflation. Such an action would begin the process of moving 
  policy away from what he perceived as an unsustainable stance. He 
  also noted that foreign competition had been restraining pressures on 
  domestic prices, and the policy course he had in mind would continue 
  to help in that regard by supporting the foreign exchange value of the 
  dollar.

Request for access to conference call record.

[SECTION]

At this meeting the Committee considered a request from Mr. 
  Henry B. Gonzalez, Chairman of the House Committee on Banking, 
  Finance, and Urban Affairs, for access by his staff to the tape 
  recording and transcript of the Committee's telephone conference on 
  October 15, 1993. The main purpose of the conference call was to 
  discuss what position the Committee should take on the release of 
  material about its deliberations that are contained in historical 
  files of meeting transcripts; the issue undoubtedly would be raised in 
  the near future, probably during upcoming testimony before Chairman 
  Gonzalez' Committee on October 19, 1993.

[SECTION]

Chairman Gonzalez had indicated that he was investigating the 
  possibility that Committee members had conspired during the conference 
  call to hide information from the House Banking Committee. The 
  accusation was wholly without merit, but at this stage the Committee 
  could fully vindicate itself only by making the tape and transcript 
  available to Congressional staff for their review.

[SECTION]

Such a step would be taken with considerable reluctance. 
  The recording in question did not contain a discussion of monetary 
  policy, but it did involve Committee deliberations, which are 
  protected from public disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act. 
  Some members expressed concern that granting access to this material 
  could be viewed as setting a precedent for the premature release of 
  other tapes and transcripts, with adverse effects on the Committee's 
  deliberations. However, the Committee's General Counsel expressed the 
  opinion that the Committee could make an exception for this transcript 
  without prejudicing its ability to withhold deliberative or other 
  privileged materials in other transcripts under the Freedom of 
  Information Act. The members agreed with a proposal from the Chairman 
  that the staff of Chairman Gonzalez and of certain other Banking 
  Committee members be allowed to listen to the tape recording of the 
  October 15 conference call. The review would be conducted at the 
  offices of the Board of Governors, and the Congressional staff members 
  would be asked to keep confidential the information to be made 
  available to them. The members indicated that it should be made clear 
  that access to the tape in question was being undertaken solely to 
  dispel the unfounded allegations regarding the Committee's actions. 
  The Committee already had decided to make public with a 5-year lag 
  lightly edited versions of all the transcripts currently in the 
  possession of the FOMC Secretariat. These transcripts as edited will 
  include all the deliberative materials except for highly sensitive 
  information that can continue to be withheld under the provisions of 
  the Freedom of Information Act.

[SECTION]

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 
  held on Thursday-Friday, February 3-4, 1994.

[SECTION]

The meeting adjourned at 1:30 p.m.
