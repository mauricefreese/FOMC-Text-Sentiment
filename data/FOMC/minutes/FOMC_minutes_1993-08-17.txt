A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in 
    the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
    in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, August 17, 1993, at 9:00 a.m.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the minutes for the meeting of the Federal 
    Open Market Committee held on July 6-7, 1993, were approved.

[SECTION]

Secretary's Note: Advice had been received of the election 
      of William J. McDonough by the Board of Directors of the 
      Federal Reserve Bank of New York as a member of the Federal 
      Open Market Committee for the period commencing July 19, 
      1993, and ending December 31, 1993, and that he had executed 
      his oath of office.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the Committee elected William J. McDonough 
    as Vice Chairman of the Committee to serve until the first meeting of 
    the Committee after December 31, 1993.

[SECTION]

The Deputy Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments in foreign exchange markets during the period since the July meeting. There were no System open market transactions in foreign currencies during this period, and thus no vote was required of the Committee.

[SECTION]

The Deputy Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period July 7, 1993, through August 16, 1993. By unanimous 
    vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic 
    and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed by the Committee suggested that 
    economic activity was expanding at a moderate pace. The limited data 
    available for the third quarter presented a mixed picture but on 
    balance pointed to continued expansion in consumption, business fixed 
    investment, and homebuilding. Employment remained on an uptrend, and 
    industrial production recently had firmed somewhat. After rising at a 
    faster rate in the early part of the year, consumer prices had changed 
    little and producer prices had fallen in recent months.

[SECTION]

Total nonfarm payroll employment, after a small gain in June, 
    expanded in July at a rate close to its average advance in earlier 
    months of the year. The services industries, led by business 
    services, provided half of the July increase. Elsewhere, considerable 
    hiring was evident in wholesale and retail trade, and construction 
    employment moved up after a small decline in June. In manufacturing, 
    more jobs were lost, although at a slower rate than earlier in the 
    year. The civilian unemployment rate dropped to 6.8 percent in July.

[SECTION]

Industrial production recovered in July from small declines 
    in May and June. Manufacturing output rose in spite of a sizable 
    cutback in motor vehicle assemblies: utility production registered a 
    strong weather-related gain; and mining output declined further. Within manufacturing, the production of consumer durable goods other 
    than automobiles and trucks rebounded in July, and the output of 
    business equipment advanced further. Total utilization of industrial 
    capacity edged higher in July, reflecting a substantial gain at 
    electric utilities: utilization of manufacturing capacity was 
    unchanged.

[SECTION]

Retail sales increased slightly further in July after a 
    sizable rise in the second quarter. Spending on automobiles was down 
    for a second straight month, but sales were strong at apparel, 
    furniture and appliance, and general merchandise stores. Total 
    housing starts, depressed by wet weather and floods in some areas of 
    the country, were down somewhat in July; however, permit issuance 
    moved up, suggesting that homebuilding activity remained in a mild 
    uptrend. In addition, consumer surveys indicated that attitudes 
    toward homebuying continued to be strongly positive during July, and 
    builders' assessments of home sales improved substantially.

[SECTION]

Business fixed investment increased in the second quarter at 
    about the rapid pace of the first quarter. Business spending for 
    equipment remained strong, with solid increases in business purchases 
    of motor vehicles, computers, and a wide range of machinery and 
    equipment. However, outlays for aircraft declined in the second 
    quarter, retracing some of the substantial first-quarter rise. The 
    limited information available for the third quarter pointed to some 
    slowing of the growth of business spending for equipment. In the 
    second quarter, nonresidential building activity posted its largest 
    advance in three years. Expenditures were up across a broad array of 
    categories, with investment in institutional and public utilities 
    structures being particularly strong.

[SECTION]

Business inventories expanded moderately during the second 
    quarter, and inventory accumulation was broadly in line with sales 
    over the first half of the year. In manufacturing, stocks edged lower 
    in June, reflecting a further decline in inventories held by aircraft 
    producers. Outside of the aircraft industry, inventory changes were 
    mixed. For manufacturing as a whole, the ratio of inventories to 
    shipments fell in June to one of the lowest levels in recent years. 
    In the wholesale trade sector, inventories expanded modestly in June, 
    and with sales lower, the inventory-to-sales ratio for the sector 
    increased slightly. Retail inventories, after changing little in May, 
    rose slightly more than sales in June, and the stocks-to-sales ratio 
    for the retail sector remained near the high end of its range for the 
    past several years.

[SECTION]

The nominal U.S. merchandise trade deficit was considerably 
    smaller in May than the deficits recorded in March and April: however, 
    the deficit for April and May combined was larger than the average 
    rate for the first quarter. The value of exports rose slightly in 
    May; increases in sales abroad of industrial supplies, machinery, and 
    consumer goods offset declines in agricultural products, civilian 
    aircraft, and motor vehicles and parts. A drop in the value of 
    imports was spread across a wide range of products, particularly 
    automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. The economic performance of the major foreign industrial countries was mixed in the second 
    quarter. Output continued to decline in western Germany, and economic 
    activity in Japan appeared to have stalled after modest growth in the 
    first quarter. In contrast, economic recovery continued in Canada and 
    the United Kingdom.

[SECTION]

Producer prices of finished goods declined in July for a 
    second consecutive month. Prices of finished foods edged lower, and prices of finished energy goods, particularly gasoline and fuel oil 
    fell significantly; excluding the food and energy components, producer 
    prices edged up in July and to that point in the year had risen at a 
    slightly lower rate than was recorded in 1992. At the consumer level, 
    prices for nonfood, non-energy items were up slightly in both June and 
    July and for the year to date had increased a little more slowly than 
    last year. Hourly compensation for private industry workers rose in 
    the second quarter at about the rate seen last year. Average hourly 
    earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged on 
    balance over June and July, but for the year through July these 
    earnings had increased at the same pace as in 1992.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on July 6-7, 1993, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that retained a tilt toward possible firming 
    of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, 
    the directive indicated that in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, 
    and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary 
    developments, slightly greater reserve restraint would be acceptable 
    or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the 
    intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this 
    directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of the 
    broader monetary aggregates over the third quarter.

[SECTION]

Throughout the intermeeting period, open market operations 
    were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on 
    reserve positions. Two upward revisions were made to expected levels 
    of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing in anticipation of further 
    increases in demand for seasonal credit. Borrowing averaged close to expected levels over most of the intermeeting interval, and the federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent.

[SECTION]

Money market interest rates were little changed on balance 
    over the intermeeting period, while rates on intermediate-term U.S. 
    Treasury obligations and on fixed-rate mortgages dropped slightly. 
    Yields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds were down by more, 
    with the rate on the 30-year Treasury bond falling below 6-1/2 
    percent. Many market interest rates moved higher after Chairman 
    Greenspan's congressional testimony on July 20, which was perceived by 
    market participants as suggesting a greater likelihood of some 
    tightening of monetary policy in the future. Subsequently, interest 
    rates generally retreated in reaction to incoming economic data 
    indicating subdued inflation pressures and to the passage of the 
    deficit-reduction legislation. Major indexes of stock prices 
    increased somewhat over the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on 
    balance over the intermeeting period. The dollar strengthened 
    slightly against the German mark, but it rose by significantly more 
    against most other European currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism 
    in the aftermath of a widening of the margins within which participating currencies are allowed to fluctuate relative to each other. 
    The widening, which was in response to massive selling pressures on 
    the French franc and several other currencies, followed sharp 
    increases in short-term interest rates in the affected countries. 
    With exchange market participants continuing to focus on Japan's trade 
    surplus, the dollar fell substantially against the yen.

[SECTION]

M2 expanded only slightly in July after growing appreciably over the second quarter. The continued strength of inflows to bond and stock mutual funds suggested that households were still realigning 
    their portfolios toward assets outside the monetary aggregates. 
    Through July, M2 was estimated to have grown at a rate close to the 
    lower end of the Committee's range for the year. M3 contracted 
    slightly in June and July, owing in part to a substantial drop in 
    institution-only money market mutual funds, whose returns had not kept 
    pace with the increase in money market rates in late spring. In 
    addition, depository institutions placed greater reliance on various 
    nondeposit sources of funds, including the issuance of equity and 
    subordinated debt. Through July, M3 had declined a little and was 
    slightly below its annual range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had 
    expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, and for the year through 
    June was estimated to have increased at a rate in the lower half of 
    the Committee's monitoring range.

[SECTION]

The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested 
    moderate growth in economic activity and modest reductions in margins 
    of unemployed labor and capital through next year. The fiscal 
    restraint stemming from the recent legislation and uncertainty about 
    other government policies would act as a drag on the economy. On the 
    other hand, lower interest rates were expected to contribute to 
    further gains in spending on consumer durables, housing, and business 
    fixed investment. Continued expansion also would be supported by 
    further improvements in the availability of credit, a small boost to 
    production over the next several quarters associated with rebuilding 
    activity in areas of the Midwest affected by the recent floods, and a 
    pickup in foreign demand resulting from some strengthening in economic 
    activity abroad. The projected slack in labor and product markets, 
    coupled with some tempering of inflation expectations, was expected to 
    foster modest further reductions in wage and price inflation.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of prospective economic conditions, members commented that recent developments had not materially 
    altered the outlook for moderate and sustained growth in economic 
    activity. Despite widespread indications of pessimistic consumer and 
    business attitudes, overall consumer spending and business investment 
    appeared to be reasonably well maintained. Likewise, the outlook for 
    increased fiscal restraint associated with the recently enacted 
    deficit-reduction legislation needed to be weighed against the favorable effects on spending of reduced interest rates in intermediate- 
    and long-term debt markets, the improved balance sheets of consumers 
    and businesses, and the indications of a somewhat better availability 
    of loans from financial intermediaries. In an environment of moderate 
    economic growth, the fundamentals bearing on the outlook for inflation 
    were consistent with further disinflation, and the members drew some 
    encouragement from consumer and producer price developments in recent 
    months. Several cautioned, however, that recent price measures 
    probably overstated the reduction in inflation, just as the surge in 
    prices earlier in the year seemed to have overstated the underlying 
    inflation trend. Members also referred to the persistence of 
    inflationary expectations among business executives and consumers. 
    Thus, while the rise in inflation appeared to have been arrested, any 
    further progress toward price stability was likely to be limited over 
    the quarters ahead.

[SECTION]

Business contacts and other sources of information suggested 
    little change since the July meeting in the pace or composition of 
    economic activity in different parts of the country. Descriptions of 
    economic performance varied from slow to moderate growth in most 
    regions, though business activity probably continued to weaken 
    in some major areas such as California. Despite sustained, if not ebullient, growth in sales to consumers and the relative strength in 
    business investment spending in the first half of this year, business 
    sentiment was widely described as cautious or negative even in some regions whose economies were outperforming the nation as a whole. 
    According to business contacts, the recent enactment of deficit-reduction legislation had tended to mitigate concerns about the size 
    of future federal deficits, but business executives were now focusing 
    on the implications of higher taxes and many were expressing 
    apprehension about further though still unannounced tax increases that 
    might be associated with health care reform. Business sentiment and 
    sales also were being affected adversely in many areas by cutbacks in 
    defense contracts and closings of military installations and by the 
    weakness in foreign demand for some products.

[SECTION]

With regard to developments and prospects in key sectors of 
    the economy, members noted that despite further survey indications of 
    eroding consumer confidence, consumer expenditures had strengthened in 
    recent months after a pause earlier in the year. The pickup had 
    featured rising sales of motor vehicles, and while the latter had 
    slipped recently, a number of special factors such as shortages of 
    popular models at the end of the model year and the effects of 
    flooding in some parts of the Midwest suggested the need to withhold 
    judgment on any downward shift in the underlying demand for motor 
    vehicles. Tourism was reported to have strengthened considerably in 
    many areas this summer, though there were major exceptions. As had 
    been true for an extended period, consumer attitudes continued to be 
    inhibited by concerns about employment opportunities, especially given 
    further reductions in defense spending, the ongoing restructuring and 
    related downsizing of many business operations, and the continuing 
    efforts by business firms to limit the number of their permanent employees in order to hold down the rising costs of health care and 
    other nonwage worker benefits. Members noted, however, that the 
    growth in employment thus far this year, while tending to involve many 
    low paying jobs, had greatly exceeded the rate of expansion in 1992. 
    In the view of at least some members, appreciable further growth was 
    likely as business firms found it increasingly difficult in an 
    expanding economy to meet growing demands through outsourcing, 
    temporary workers, and overtime work. Some members also noted that 
    the newly legislated taxes on higher incomes would tend to curtail 
    some consumer spending. The timing of that effect was uncertain; tax 
    liabilities had already risen, but some payments on the added tax 
    liabilities were not due until April of 1994 and 1995.

[SECTION]

Members anticipated that building activity, notably housing 
    construction, would provide some stimulus to the expansion. Although 
    indicators of housing activity were somewhat mixed for the nation as a 
    whole, sales of new and existing homes were brisk in many regions 
    and even sales of second homes were reported to be improving in some 
    areas. Prospective homebuyers continued to exercise considerable 
    caution, but reductions in mortgage rates and generally improved 
    affordability pointed to rising housing sales and construction over 
    the quarters ahead. In the nonresidential sector, there was growing 
    evidence of some strengthening in the construction of commercial and 
    institutional structures, but overcapacity was likely to depress the 
    construction of new office buildings for an extended period in most 
    parts of the country. In some areas, infrastructure and other 
    rebuilding associated with the recent floods was likely to stimulate 
    some construction activity later this year.

[SECTION]

With regard to the external sector of the economy, the 
    members again noted a somewhat mixed picture. Exporters from some parts of the country continued to report relatively brisk sales 
    abroad, but many domestic producers were expressing concerns about 
    weak markets in key foreign nations. Against the background of more 
    stimulative economic policies in a number of those countries, some 
    overall strengthening in the major foreign economies was viewed as a 
    reasonable expectation, but the overall growth in exports was likely 
    to lag the anticipated expansion in imports over the projection 
    horizon. The North American Free Trade Agreement now under consideration in the Congress was a topic of active discussion among business 
    contacts, and the uncertain outcome of that treaty was a matter of 
    concern in several parts of the country.

[SECTION]

Members observed that the more favorable performance of key 
    measures of prices in recent months had tended to relieve earlier 
    concerns about a possible worsening of inflation. However, because 
    the recent price indexes probably overstated the improvement in the 
    trend rate of inflation, it was too early to determine whether they 
    pointed to renewed disinflation. In any event, a number of 
    fundamental factors appeared to have favorable implications for the 
    inflation outlook, notably the prospect that some slack in labor and 
    capital resources would persist in the context of projections that 
    pointed to a relatively moderate rate of economic expansion. Members 
    continued to cite reports from numerous business firms regarding their 
    inability to raise prices because of the highly competitive markets in 
    which those firms had to operate. Many business contacts also 
    referred to the absence of significant increases--and indeed to 
    occasional decreases--in the costs of their outside purchases. Oil 
    price developments in world markets and the ongoing competition from 
    foreign producers also were noted as favorable elements in the outlook 
    for inflation. On the negative side, adverse weather conditions in recent months including severe floods in the Midwest appeared to have 
    fostered some upward pressure on food prices, and higher taxes would 
    raise gasoline prices in the fourth quarter. Perhaps of greater 
    significance, business contacts and surveys of households indicated 
    persisting expectations that inflation would rise at some point. In 
    this connection, however, passage of the federal deficit-reduction 
    legislation and the Committee's reaffirmation in its directive and in 
    congressional testimony of its commitment to price stability seemed to 
    have had a constructive effect on attitudes in financial markets and 
    on long-term interest rates, and these developments could prove to be harbingers of more favorable inflation attitudes more generally.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, the members agreed that recent developments pointed to 
    the desirability of a steady policy course. While economic growth did 
    not seem particularly robust, neither was it clear that a disinflationary trend had been reestablished. Many members observed that real 
    short-term interest rates were at very low levels, indeed slightly 
    negative by some calculations, and while real intermediate- and long-term interest rates were higher, it was apparent that monetary policy 
    was in an accommodative posture. This conclusion was seen as 
    reinforcing the view that monetary policy probably would have to move 
    in the direction of restraint at some point to resist any incipient 
    tendency for inflationary pressures to intensify. For now, the 
    relatively slow economic expansion in the first half of the year, the 
    fiscal restraint associated with the deficit-reduction legislation, 
    other obstacles to economic growth, and the encouraging inflation 
    statistics for recent months argued against any near-term policy 
    adjustment.

[SECTION]

Moreover, there was no compelling evidence that current 
    monetary policy was fostering credit flows usually associated with 
    speculative excesses or impending increases in price pressures. 
    Growth in the broad measures of money and in the debt of nonfinancial 
    sectors remained fairly damped despite indications of greater willingness to supply credit by banks, other financial intermediaries, and 
    investors in securities markets. With regard to the monetary aggregates, low short-term interest rates undoubtedly were contributing to 
    large shifts of funds from depository institutions, notably from 
    components of M2 and M3 to stock and bond mutual funds and to other 
    financial instruments, and thus to the sluggish behavior of the broad measures of money. In this connection, a staff analysis pointed to 
    continuing slow growth in M2 over the near term and, on the assumption of little or no change in the degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions, to growth for the year at a rate around the lower end of 
    the Committee's range. Growth in M3 was likely to fall marginally 
    below the Committee's range for the year. On the other hand, growth 
    in Ml and in various reserve measures was expected to remain 
    relatively robust.

[SECTION]

Turning to possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period ahead, the members endorsed a proposal to return to an 
    unbiased intermeeting instruction that did not incorporate any 
    presumption with regard to the direction of possible intermeeting 
    policy changes. The members agreed that the probability of an 
    intermeeting policy adjustment was relatively remote. Incoming data 
    on economic activity and prices had reduced concerns that inflation 
    and inflationary expectations might be worsening. The Committee 
    retained its fundamental objectives of fostering economic expansion at 
    a sustainable pace that was consistent with further progress over time toward stable prices. However, it now appeared less likely than at the time of the May and July meetings that the Committee needed to bias its consideration of responses to incoming information in the intermeeting period toward possible tightening in order to achieve those objectives. One member, while agreeing that a tightening move 
    would not be appropriate under current circumstances, nonetheless believed that monetary policy had been overly stimulative for some time and that the Committee should move toward restraint at the first favorable opportunity.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members expressed a preference for a directive that called for 
    maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. 
    They also indicated their support of a directive that did not include 
    a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the 
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable 
    economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
    financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that 
    slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions 
    contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with 
    modest growth in M2 and little net change in M3 over the balance of 
    the third quarter.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
    New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace. 
      Total nonfarm payroll employment increased in July at a 
      rate close to its average advance in earlier months of 
      the year, and the civilian unemployment rate declined 
      to 6.8 percent. Industrial production turned up in 
      July after posting small declines in May and June. 
      Retail sales edged higher in July following a sizable 
      rise in the second quarter. Housing starts were down 
      somewhat in July, but permits moved up. Available 
      indicators point to continued expansion in business 
      capital spending. The nominal U.S. merchandise trade 
      deficit declined in May, but for April and May combined 
      it was larger than its average rate in the first 
      quarter. After rising at a faster rate in the early 
      part of the year, consumer prices have changed little 
      and producer prices have fallen in recent months.

[SECTION]

Short-and intermediate-term interest rates have 
      changed little since the Committee meeting on July 6-7, while yields on long-term Treasury and corporate bonds 
      have declined somewhat. In foreign exchange markets, 
      the trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the 
      other G-10 currencies was about unchanged on balance 
      over the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

After expanding appreciably over the second 
      quarter, M2 increased slightly further in July and M3 
      declined. For the year through July, M2 is estimated 
      to have grown at a rate close to the lower end of the 
      Committee's range for the year, and M3 at a rate 
      slightly below its range. Total domestic nonfinancial 
      debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent months, 
      and for the year through June it is estimated to have 
      increased at a rate in the lower half of the 
      Committee's monitoring range.

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting in July lowered the ranges it had established 
      in February for growth of M2 and M3 to ranges of 1 to 5 
      percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from 
      the fourth quarter of 1992 to the fourth quarter of 
      1993. The Committee anticipated that developments 
      contributing to unusual velocity increases would 
      persist over the balance of the year and that money 
      growth within these lower ranges would be consistent 
      with its broad policy objectives. The monitoring range 
      for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt also was 
      lowered to 4 to 8 percent for the year. For 1994, the 
      Committee agreed on tentative ranges for monetary 
      growth, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
      fourth quarter of 1994,  of 1 to 5 percent for M2 and 
      0 to 4 percent for M3. The Committee provisionally set 
      the monitoring range for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt at 4 to 8 percent for 1994. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be 
      evaluated in the light of progress toward price level 
      stability, movements in their velocities, and 
      developments in the economy and financial markets.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent 
      with modest growth in M2 and little net change in M3 
      over the balance of the third quarter.
