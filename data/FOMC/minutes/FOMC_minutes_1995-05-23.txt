Secretary's Note: Advice had been received that Ernest T. 
      Patrikis had been elected by the board of directors of the 
      Federal Reserve Bank of New York as an alternate member of 
      the Federal Open Market Committee for the period June 1, 
      1995, through December 31, 1995, and that he had executed his 
      oath of office.

[SECTION]

Program for Safeguarding FOMC Information

[SECTION]

At this meeting the Committee amended its "Program for  
    Security of FOMC Information." The changes included an increase in  
    the number of staff at the Federal Reserve Banks who could be given  
    access to confidential Class I and Class II FOMC information. The  
    Committee also liberalized its rule relating to attendance at FOMC  
    meetings to allow First Vice Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks  
    to attend meetings on a rotating basis. Other changes of a technical  
    or updating nature also were made to the Program. The Committee's  
    brief discussion of this organizational matter was not recorded in  
    keeping with the decision made at the meeting on January 31 February  
    1, 1995 normally not to record discussions unrelated to  
    monetary policy.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal 
    Open Market Committee held on March 28, 1995, were approved.

[SECTION]

The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on 
    developments in foreign exchange markets and on System foreign 
    currency transactions during the period March 28, 1995 through May 22, 
    1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Manager also reported on developments in domestic 
    financial markets and on System open market transactions in government 
    securities and federal agency obligations during the period March 28, 
    1995, through May 22, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified 
    these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Manager requested a temporary increase of $2 billion, to 
    $10 billion, in the limit on intermeeting changes in outright System 
    Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities. He 
    advised the Committee that the current leeway of $8 billion might not 
    be sufficient to accommodate the potentially large need for additional 
    reserves over the intermeeting period to meet an anticipated seasonal 
    rise in the domestic demand for currency as well as continued currency 
    outflows to foreign countries. By unanimous vote, the Committee 
    amended paragraph 1(a) of the Authorization for Domestic Open Market 
    Operations to raise the limit to $10 billion for the intermeeting 
    period ending with the close of business on July 5, 1995.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
    financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the 
    intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
    information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
    Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
    policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
    Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the 
    expansion of economic activity had slowed considerably further and 
    that rates of resource utilization had declined. Although business 
    investment in equipment and structures had remained strong, overall 
    final sales had expanded less rapidly and inventories had continued to 
    build. Manufacturing output appeared to be down appreciably, in large 
    measure reflecting cutbacks in motor vehicle production, and the slump 
    in housing starts since the turn of the year was depressing 
    construction activity. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices 
    had increased a little faster thus far this year, while advances in 
    labor compensation costs had remained subdued.

[SECTION]

Nonfarm payroll employment posted reduced gains in the first 
    quarter and changed little in April; special factors and seasonal 
    adjustment difficulties may have depressed reported job growth in 
    April. Hiring in service-producing industries was down sharply from 
    the pace in previous months, with jobs in personnel supply services 
    falling for a second consecutive month after three years of rapid 
    growth. Employment in manufacturing decreased further, and the number 
    of construction jobs contracted after a sizable weather-related surge 
    in March. Initial claims for unemployment insurance increased 
    considerably in recent weeks, and the civilian unemployment rate rose 
    to 5.8 percent in April.

[SECTION]

Industrial production fell further in April, with 
    manufacturing registering a substantial decline. The drop in 
    industrial output largely reflected a cutback in the production of 
    motor vehicles and parts, but declines in output also were evident in 
    other cyclically sensitive sectors, such as non-auto consumer durables 
    and construction supplies. Production of business equipment other 
    than motor vehicles registered a small gain. Total utilization of 
    industrial capacity continued to decline in April; however, operating 
    rates in manufacturing remained at relatively high levels.

[SECTION]

Retail sales were down in April after having risen moderately 
    over the first quarter; a steep drop in sales of motor vehicles 
    accounted for all of the April decline. Total expenditures on other 
    types of goods edged higher in April, even though sales of apparel, 
    furniture, and home appliances were noticeably weaker. Housing starts 
    changed little in April after having declined sharply in the first 
    quarter, and the inventory of new homes for sale remained relatively 
    large. On the other hand, sales of both new and existing homes rose 
    moderately in March after sizable declines in February, and recent 
    surveys indicated some improvement in attitudes toward homebuying.

[SECTION]

Shipments of nondefense capital goods remained on a strong 
    uptrend in March, with outlays for office and computing equipment 
    registering another sharp increase. Manufacturers of heavy trucks 
    continued to operate at capacity to meet demand; by contrast, business 
    expenditures for motor vehicles reportedly plunged in April. Data on 
    orders for nondefense capital goods pointed to further strong 
    expansion of spending on business equipment in the months ahead, 
    although gains appeared likely to be smaller than those of the past 
    several quarters. Nonresidential construction continued to rise in 
    March, and data on permits for new construction suggested that 
    building activity would advance further in coming months, though 
    perhaps at a somewhat slower rate.

[SECTION]

Business inventories surged again in March, and the pace of 
    inventory accumulation over the first quarter was substantially higher 
    than the average rate for the second half of 1994. Much of the first-quarter increase in stocks reflected a buildup in inventories of motor 
    vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels. Non-auto stocks also 
    increased at a brisk pace in the first quarter, accompanied by the 
    emergence of scattered signs of inventory imbalances in furniture, 
    appliances, and apparel at the retail level and in construction 
    supplies at earlier stages of production and distribution. The stock-to-sales ratio in manufacturing was unchanged in March from the very 
    low fourth-quarter level. At the wholesale level, the ratio of 
    inventories to sales rose in March but remained within the range of 
    the last several years. Inventory accumulation in the retail sector 
    slowed in March despite a further rise in inventories of motor 
    vehicles. For the retail sector as a whole, the inventory-to-sales 
    ratio increased in March to the top end of its range of the last two 
    years; when the motor vehicle components of stocks and sales are 
    excluded, however, the ratio was near the middle of its range in 
    recent years.

[SECTION]

The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services was 
    little changed in March from the February level and remained 
    substantially narrower than in January. On a quarterly average basis, 
    the trade deficit widened in the first quarter as growth in the value 
    of exports slowed while the expansion in the value of imports 
    continued unabated. A drop in shipments to Mexico was among the 
    factors holding down export growth in March. Data available for the 
    first quarter indicated that economic recovery continued in the major 
    foreign industrial countries as a group but that the pace varied 
    significantly across countries. There were signs of sustained growth 
    in the United Kingdom, slower growth in Canada, renewed recovery in 
    Japan, and weakness in France and Italy.

[SECTION]

Inflation had picked up somewhat in the early months of 1995. 
    At the consumer level, prices rose a little more rapidly in the first 
    quarter, despite unchanged food prices and lower energy prices. In 
    April, a surge in food prices and a rebound in energy prices 
    contributed to a further step-up in consumer inflation. At the 
    producer level, prices of finished goods followed a roughly similar 
    pattern, increasing at a slightly faster pace in the first quarter and 
    then more briskly in April. The April rise partly reflected a sharp 
    jump in the prices of finished energy goods, but prices of non-energy, 
    nonfood items also advanced at a somewhat faster rate. At earlier 
    stages of production, prices of intermediate materials continued to 
    increase rapidly in April. By contrast, trends in labor compensation 
    costs remained subdued. Gains in hourly compensation of private 
    industry workers slowed further in the first quarter of 1995, with a 
    continuing moderation in the cost of benefits accounting for all of 
    the deceleration in compensation.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on March 28, 1995, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions but that included a bias toward the possible 
    firming of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. 
    Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the 
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable 
    economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
    financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve 
    restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
    might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve 
    conditions associated with this directive were expected to be 
    consistent with moderate growth in the broader monetary aggregates 
    over coming months.

[SECTION]

Open market operations during the intermeeting period were 
    directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions. Adjustment plus seasonal borrowing trended higher over the 
    period, reflecting a rising need for seasonal credit at the beginning 
    of the planting season, while the federal funds rate continued to 
    average close to 6 percent.

[SECTION]

Most market interest rates moved lower over the intermeeting 
    period in reaction to weaker-than-expected incoming economic data, 
    which market participants interpreted as signaling a considerable 
    slowing of the economic expansion and a growing likelihood that the 
    next monetary policy move would be in an easing direction. Market 
    assessments that the prospects for major reductions in budget deficits 
    were improving also seemed to contribute to the drop in rates. In 
    this environment, the release of data indicating large increases in 
    consumer and producer prices for April only temporarily interrupted 
    the decline in rates. Intermediate- and long-term interest rates 
    posted the largest declines over the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
    dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined substantially 
    further over the first half of the intermeeting period. In mid-April, 
    the dollar reached a record low against the Japanese yen and 
    approached a record low against the German mark. The dollar's 
    weakness appeared to have been related in part to further indications 
    of softening economic activity and related declines in interest rates 
    in the United States and to increasing trade tensions with Japan. 
    Late in the period, the dollar reversed its course and moved up 
    sharply against the yen and the mark; monetary easing abroad, 
    improving prospects for reductions in the U.S. budget deficit, and 
    stabilizing financial conditions in Mexico appeared to contribute to 
    the turnaround. The dollar ended the intermeeting period higher on 
    balance against the other G-10 currencies.

[SECTION]

The growth of M2 picked up further in April, reflecting in 
    part the need for additional liquid balances to make unusually heavy 
    final tax payments; these payments resulted from the stronger economy 
    in 1994 and from new tax regulations allowing individuals to delay a 
    larger portion of their tax payments until April. The expansion of M2 
    also appeared to be boosted by the increased relative attractiveness 
    of small time deposits and money market funds following declines in 
    market interest rates. For the year through April, M2 grew at a rate 
    in the lower half of its range for 1995 while M3 expanded at a rate 
    somewhat above its range. The persisting strength of M3 in April 
    largely reflected the needs of commercial banks to fund continuing 
    heavy credit demands by households and businesses. Total domestic 
    nonfinancial debt had grown at a rate a little above the midpoint of 
    its monitoring range in recent months.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
    growth of economic activity was slowing somewhat more than previously 
    anticipated, with the recent plunge in motor vehicle sales prompting a 
    deeper-than-expected reduction in the production of cars and light 
    trucks. Economic expansion would average less than the rate of 
    increase in the economy's potential output for a number of months, but 
    the favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally 
    that had occurred in stock and bond markets were expected to provide 
    underlying support for aggregate demand later in the year and in 1996. 
    The forecast continued to anticipate that consumer spending would be 
    restrained by smaller gains in real incomes and the satisfaction of 
    pent-up demands for motor vehicles and other durable goods. Business 
    outlays for new equipment were expected to decelerate substantially in 
    response to the slower growth of sales and profits. Homebuilding was 
    projected to pick up somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline 
    in mortgage rates. Developments in Mexico might depress U.S. exports 
    further, but mainly in the very near term given the size of the 
    adjustments already evident in the Mexican current account. With this 
    influence waning, sustained growth in the economies of other U.S. 
    trading partners was expected to boost export demand. Considerable 
    uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but the forecast 
    maintained the greater degree of fiscal restraint that had been 
    assumed since early in the year. In the staff's judgment, the 
    prospects for some easing of pressures on resources suggested that 
    price inflation would likely moderate from its recently higher level.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    economic conditions, members reported on statistical and anecdotal 
    indications of further slowing in the expansion of economic activity 
    and some related easing of pressures on labor and other producer 
    resources. A number commented that they anticipated a relatively 
    sluggish economic performance over coming months as production was cut 
    back to bring inventories into better balance with sales. However, 
    underlying demand was likely to remain sufficiently robust, especially 
    in light of developments in financial markets, to avert a cumulative 
    decline in business activity and, indeed, to return economic growth to 
    a pace broadly in line with potential. Members cited in particular 
    the strength in business fixed investment and the potential for 
    improvement in housing activity and the trade balance as factors that 
    should help to sustain the expansion. Nonetheless, the longer-run 
    outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty, especially given 
    the undecided course of fiscal policy and the ongoing inventory 
    correction; the ultimate extent of that correction and its effects on 
    overall economic performance were subject to a cyclical dynamic whose 
    outcome could not be predicted with confidence. A worsening in key 
    measures of inflation, including the consumer price index and the 
    producer price index for finished goods, was a disappointing--if not 
    unexpected--development. A number of members expressed concern that 
    the risks were still tilted in the direction of some further step-up 
    in inflation; however, others were more inclined to the view that 
    inflation was not likely to rise much further in a climate of moderate 
    growth in demand, intense competitive pressures in many markets, and 
    relatively subdued increases in labor costs.

[SECTION]

Members commented that a reduction in the rate of inventory 
    investment was likely to be the dominant influence on the near-term 
    performance of the economy. Some also saw a risk that a significantly 
    greater-than-expected softening in inventory accumulation might have 
    adverse, and possibly cumulative, effects of a longer-term nature on 
    production and incomes and thus on consumer and business spending. 
    With the exception of the motor vehicle industry, however, current 
    inventory levels generally were quite low in relation to sales and 
    potential inventory adjustments were likely to be limited in size. 
    Once further inventory adjustments were completed, the rate of 
    accumulation could be expected to remain well below the unsustainable 
    pace experienced over the past year and perhaps settle into a pattern 
    where changes in inventories became a relatively neutral factor in the 
    ongoing economic expansion.

[SECTION]

In their comments about broad factors underlying the economic 
    outlook, members reported that current business and consumer sentiment 
    remained generally favorable across the nation. Despite the softening 
    demand in some markets or industries, notably that for motor vehicles, 
    business contacts continued to express optimism about the outlook for 
    their firms, though some of their comments were tempered by greater 
    caution than had been observed earlier. A number of members referred 
    to the general financial climate as an important element in the 
    outlook for sustained economic expansion. They noted that the decline 
    in interest rates had favorable implications for demand in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. The rise in equity prices also was 
    contributing to reductions in the cost of capital to businesses, and 
    banks continued to ease terms and standards on loans. In addition, 
    the rise in stock and bond prices had increased the net worth of many 
    households, though some concern was expressed about the sustainability 
    of the stock market's strong performance.

[SECTION]

With regard to developments in key sectors of the economy, 
    the slowdown in the growth of consumer spending was somewhat more 
    pronounced than anticipated earlier. Some rebound in consumer demand 
    seemed likely and already appeared to be occurring in the motor 
    vehicle industry in May. Underlying conditions for further growth in 
    consumer spending were viewed as relatively favorable; these 
    conditions included strengthened balance sheets stemming from 
    developments in financial markets, continued growth of incomes, and 
    aggressive extensions of consumer credit by a number of lenders. In 
    at least one view, however, consumer credit had been growing at a pace 
    that could not be sustained and the inevitable correction could 
    coincide with and exacerbate emerging weakness in consumer demand. On 
    balance, growth in personal consumption expenditures was seen as 
    likely to continue over coming quarters but at a reduced pace given 
    the apparent satisfaction of a large portion of earlier pent-up 
    demands for consumer durables and some expected moderation in the 
    growth of jobs and incomes.

[SECTION]

Business investment remained on a strong uptrend as numerous 
    firms continued to respond to the need to relieve pressures on 
    existing capacity and to increase operating efficiencies in the face 
    of vigorous competition. Rapid growth in profits and a ready 
    availability of financing also were cited as factors tending to 
    support business investment spending. The increase in such spending 
    was likely to moderate over the projection horizon, though to a still 
    brisk pace, as declining growth in demand and easing pressures on 
    capacity induced growing caution in business investment decisions. 
    Indeed, the growth in expenditures for producer durable equipment 
    already appeared to be moderating from an extremely rapid pace, though 
    nonresidential construction was reported to be posting solid gains in 
    several parts of the country.

[SECTION]

Members also expected some strengthening in residential 
    construction following the large declines in mortgage interest rates 
    that had occurred since late 1994. Housing construction had trended 
    lower since the start of the year, but several indicators pointed to a 
    revival. The latter included surveys showing improving homebuyer 
    attitudes and builder assessments of the outlook for new home sales, 
    and rising applications to purchase homes. Sizable inventories of 
    unsold new homes would probably continue to damp construction activity 
    for some months, but contacts in the real estate and mortgage finance 
    industries were more optimistic about the outlook for housing.

[SECTION]

The foreign trade sector likewise was expected to make an 
    appreciable contribution to the expansion of economic activity in 
    coming quarters. The robust uptrend in U.S. exports during 1994 had 
    been slowed to a considerable extent thus far this year by the sharp 
    adjustment in trade with Mexico, but in the view of several members 
    that adjustment might now be largely completed. In that event, gains 
    in exports could be expected to resume at a fairly brisk pace despite 
    indications of reduced economic growth in some key foreign countries. 
    This assessment was supported by anecdotal reports of rising foreign 
    demand for some U.S. products in the context of the generally improved 
    international competitive position of the United States. 
    Concurrently, growth in imports would tend to be held down by the 
    projected slowing in the expansion of domestic demand. On the 
    negative side, some members referred to the possibility that a longer 
    period might be needed to resolve the difficulties being experienced 
    by Mexico, and several expressed particular concern about the 
    potential for relatively severe disruptions to trade if current 
    negotiations with Japan were not successfully concluded.

[SECTION]

Fiscal policy was seen as a major uncertainty in the economic 
    outlook. Federal purchases of goods and services were expected to 
    continue trending lower and the growth of transfer payments was likely 
    to be trimmed, but the extent and timing of fiscal restraint could not 
    be determined while federal deficit reduction continued to be debated 
    in the Congress. In the view of at least some members, however, a 
    larger fiscal contraction than was commonly expected might well 
    materialize, perhaps starting later this year. The course of fiscal 
    legislation undoubtedly would continue to affect financial markets 
    and, in the opinion of some members, would need to be taken into 
    account in the formulation of monetary policy.

[SECTION]

Concerning inflation, several members commented that the rise 
    in consumer prices and some other broad measures of inflation in 
    recent months appeared to reflect cyclical developments relating to 
    the tightening of resource and product markets over the past year, 
    including the partial pass-through of sizable increases in prices at 
    earlier stages of production. In addition, higher import prices 
    might have been playing a role. A number of members expressed concern 
    that, with the economy already producing at or even slightly above its 
    sustainable potential, inflation pressures were likely to intensify if 
    the current pause in the expansion were to be followed by a period of 
    above-average growth. On the other hand, members who saw the odds as 
    pointing to a more moderate rebound after a period of relatively 
    sluggish economic performance were inclined to the view that an upward 
    trend in inflation was likely to be averted. In addition, the ongoing 
    competitive pressures in many markets, the restraint in compensation 
    increases, and the continuing efforts to cut production costs would 
    help to contain pressures on prices over time.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to maintain the 
    current stance of policy. The higher interest rates of 1994 clearly 
    had damped demand, but since year-end intermediate- and long-term 
    market rates had declined, stock market prices had risen, bank lending 
    terms had continued to ease, and the dollar had fallen against the 
    currencies of many major industrial countries. On balance, it 
    appeared that the current configuration of financial market conditions 
    and degree of monetary restraint was likely to be consistent with 
    moderate expansion in nominal GDP and prices following a period of 
    some weakness in the economy as inventory imbalances were corrected. 
    The risks of a different outcome, in either direction, seemed to be 
    reasonably balanced. In the circumstances, because the dimensions of 
    the near-term deceleration and the potential strength of underlying 
    demand remained uncertain, the members concluded that it was desirable 
    to monitor developments carefully and wait for additional information 
    before deciding on the next policy move.

[SECTION]

With regard to the possible need to adjust policy during the 
    intermeeting period, all the members were in favor of shifting 
    to an unbiased instruction that did not incorporate any presumption 
    with regard to the direction of potential intermeeting changes. The 
    members agreed that no compelling case could be made at this point for 
    potential adjustments to policy in either direction during the period 
    ahead, and retaining a bias in the directive would give a misleading 
    indication of the Committee's current intentions for the period. One 
    member expressed the view that the costs of being wrong currently 
    seemed higher in the direction of accommodating too much inflation, 
    though signs of a possible cumulative deterioration in economic 
    activity could not be ignored should they materialize. Another 
    member, who saw the longer-term risks to the economy as tilted to the 
    downside of current projections, indicated that while the recent 
    performance of the economy might argue for some easing of monetary 
    policy, a steady policy course without any bias in the intermeeting 
    instruction was appropriate for now in light of the generally

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all the 
    members supported a directive that called for maintaining the existing 
    degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a 
    presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments to policy 
    during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in the context of the 
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable 
    economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
    financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that 
    somewhat greater or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be 
    acceptable during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions 
    contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with 
    moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the months ahead.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
    New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that the expansion of economic activity has slowed 
      considerably further. In April, nonfarm payroll 
      employment was about unchanged after posting reduced 
      gains in the first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate rose to 5.8 percent. Industrial production 
      fell in April, largely reflecting a cutback in the 
      production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization 
      rates declined somewhat. Reflecting markedly weaker 
      demand for motor vehicles, total retail sales were down 
      in April after rising moderately over the first 
      quarter. Housing starts were unchanged in April after 
      declining sharply in the first quarter. Orders for 
      nondefense capital goods point to further strong 
      expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend 
      appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade 
      in goods and services widened in the first quarter from 
      its average rate in the fourth quarter. Broad indexes 
      of consumer and producer prices have increased faster 
      on average thus far this year, while advances in labor 
      compensation costs have remained subdued.

Intermediate- and long-term interest rates have 
      declined considerably further since the Committee 
      meeting on March 28, while short-term rates have 
      registered small decreases. In foreign exchange 
      markets, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in 
      terms of the other G-10 currencies, after falling to 
      low levels, rose on balance over the intermeeting 
      period.

[SECTION]

M2 and M3 strengthened in March and April. For 
      the year through April, M2 expanded at a rate in the 
      lower half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at a rate 
      somewhat above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial 
      debt has grown at a rate a bit above the midpoint of 
      its monitoring range in recent months.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
      meeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for 
      growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 
      percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee 
      anticipated that money growth within these ranges would 
      be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The 
      monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will 
      continue to be evaluated in the light of progress 
      toward price level stability, movements in their 
      velocities, and developments in the economy and 
      financial markets.

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing 
      degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the 
      context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve 
      restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be 
      acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.
