By unanimous vote, the minutes of the meeting of the Federal 
    Open Market Committee held on May 23, 1995, were approved.

[SECTION]

The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on 
    developments in foreign exchange markets and on System foreign 
    currency transactions during the period May 23, 1995, through July 5, 
    1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Manager also reported on developments in domestic 
    financial markets and on System open market transactions in government 
    securities and federal agency obligations during the period May 23, 
    1995, through July 5, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified 
    these transactions.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
    financial outlook, the ranges for growth of money and debt in 1995 and 
    1996, and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting 
    period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial information 
    available at the time of the meeting and of the Committee's discussion 
    is provided below, followed by the domestic policy directive that was 
    approved by the Committee and issued to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
    New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the 
    level of economic activity was about unchanged in the second quarter. 
    Consumer spending apparently remained sluggish, and business spending 
    on plant and equipment rose less rapidly than in other recent 
    quarters. With final sales flagging, firms sought to hold down 
    production and employment in order to keep inventories under control. 
    Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices had increased faster on 
    balance thus far this year, but signs of some moderation in inflation 
    were evident in recent price data. Growth of labor compensation costs 
    remained subdued.

[SECTION]

Nonfarm payroll employment fell substantially in May after a 
    small decline in April and reduced gains in the first quarter. 
    Payrolls in the services industry continued to rise in May, but the 
    pace of hiring was well below the average rate of increase over other 
    recent months. In manufacturing and construction, employment 
    contracted further in May, although part of the job decline in 
    construction might have been temporary, reflecting heavy rains and 
    floods in the South. The civilian unemployment rate edged lower in 
    May, to 5.7 percent, but was somewhat above its average for the first 
    quarter.

[SECTION]

Industrial production continued to weaken in May, and 
    incoming data suggested a further decline in June. Manufacturing 
    output fell in May for a fourth consecutive month, reflecting another 
    cutback in the production of motor vehicles. Output of non-auto 
    manufactured goods was unchanged, with increases in the production of 
    nondurable consumer goods and non-auto business equipment offsetting 
    declines in output elsewhere. Utilization of manufacturing capacity 
    dropped again in May but was still at a relatively high level.

[SECTION]

Nominal retail sales were about unchanged over April and May. 
    Purchases at furniture and appliance stores were up slightly on 
    balance over the two months. Sales at automotive dealerships and 
    apparel outlets fell in April but revived somewhat in May. Spending 
    at building materials stores fell in both months. The retail sales 
    reports, in combination with data on consumer prices and unit motor-vehicle sales, suggested that inflation-adjusted spending for consumer 
    goods had changed little since the fourth quarter of last year. 
    Housing starts were unchanged on balance over April and May; a 
    reduction in starts of single-family homes was offset by a rise in 
    starts of multifamily units. Adverse weather in some parts of the 
    country might have contributed to the sluggishness in starts. Home 
    sales were higher in May: Sales of new homes turned up sharply, and 
    sales of existing homes also advanced somewhat.

[SECTION]

Shipments of nondefense capital goods increased considerably 
    in May after being unchanged in April. Shipments of computing 
    equipment remained robust on balance over April and May, but growth of 
    shipments of other business equipment slowed significantly. Sales of 
    heavy trucks rebounded strongly in May from an April decline. Recent 
    data on new orders for nondefense capital goods suggested that 
    spending on business equipment might moderate somewhat in the months 
    ahead after an extended period of rapid expansion. Nonresidential 
    construction continued to trend appreciably higher in April; 
    particularly large gains were recorded in the public utility, 
    industrial, and institutional categories.

[SECTION]

Business inventories grew at a little slower rate in April 
    than in the first quarter. In manufacturing, inventory investment 
    remained brisk in April but slowed somewhat in May; the inventory-to-sales ratio for the two months was at the high end of the range for 
    the past year. At the wholesale level, the rate of increase in stocks 
    in April equaled the first-quarter pace and the ratio of stocks to 
    sales reached its highest level in several years. Inventory 
    accumulation in the retail sector was more moderate in April. More 
    than half the rise occurred at automotive establishments. The 
    inventory-to-sales ratio for retailers other than auto dealers had 
    remained stable for a number of months and was near the middle of its 
    range for recent years.

[SECTION]

The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
    widened substantially in April from its average rate for the first 
    quarter. The value of imports was up sharply, with increases posted 
    in nearly all major import categories. The value of exports rose 
    modestly from the first-quarter level; increases in exports of 
    aircraft and industrial supplies were partially offset by declines in 
    exports of automotive products to Canada and Mexico. Available data 
    indicated that, on average, economic growth in the major foreign 
    industrial countries had been sluggish in the first quarter and 
    apparently had remained so in the second quarter; growth had been 
    particularly weak in Canada and Japan.

[SECTION]

Incoming data suggested that price inflation might be slowing 
    a little after having picked up early in the year. Consumer prices 
    rose a bit less in May; energy prices recorded another sizable 
    increase, but food prices changed little and prices of other items 
    advanced more slowly. However, for the twelve months ended in May, 
    prices of nonfood, non-energy consumer items increased slightly more 
    than in the preceding twelve months. At the producer level, prices of 
    finished goods were unchanged in May, reflecting declines in the 
    prices of finished foods and finished energy goods; excluding food and 
    energy, prices of finished goods rose in May at the same rate as in 
    April. For the year ending in May, producer prices rose moderately 
    after being essentially unchanged in the previous year. At earlier 
    stages of production, producer prices grew at a considerably slower 
    rate or declined in May, suggesting some easing of cost pressures over 
    the next few months. Average hourly compensation in the nonfarm 
    business sector accelerated in the first quarter of the year, owing in 
    large part to temporary developments. Over the year ended in March, 
    this compensation measure increased somewhat more than it had over the 
    previous year. Average hourly earnings declined in May, but the 
    change in hourly earnings over the past twelve months was slightly 
    larger than the advance over the preceding twelve-month period.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on May 23, 1995, the Committee adopted a 
    directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the 
    likely direction of any adjustments to policy during the intermeeting 
    period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the context of the 
    Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable 
    economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, 
    financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve 
    restraint or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable 
    during the intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated 
    with this directive were expected to be consistent with moderate 
    growth in the broader monetary aggregates over the months ahead.

[SECTION]

Open market operations during the intermeeting period were 
    directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve 
    positions. The federal funds rate generally remained near 6 percent, 
    but most short-term interest rates were down on balance in response to 
    incoming economic data, particularly the employment report for May, 
    that were seen by market participants as increasing the likelihood 
    that monetary policy would be eased in the near future. Longer-term 
    interest rates also declined in reaction to growing indications that 
    efforts to narrow substantially the U.S. budget deficit might be 
    successful. Yields on corporate and municipal obligations fell less 
    than Treasury rates and risk spreads widened a little, particularly 
    for junk bonds. Major indexes of equity prices rose over the 
    intermeeting period, partly in response to lower interest rates.

[SECTION]

In foreign exchange markets over the intermeeting period, the 
    trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10 
    currencies declined considerably on balance. The dollar fell sharply 
    in the week after the May meeting on further news of weakening in the 
    U.S. economy but rebounded somewhat at the end of the month when 
    concerted central-bank intervention was carried out. The dollar 
    remained relatively stable over the balance of the period.

[SECTION]

Growth of M2 strengthened substantially in May and June. 
    Downward adjustments in returns on deposits and retail money fund 
    shares had lagged declines in market interest rates in recent months, 
    and investors evidently responded by shifting funds from market 
    instruments into these M2 assets. For the year through June, M2 
    expanded at a rate in the upper half of its range for 1995. M3 also 
    accelerated in May and June; and for the year through June, this 
    aggregate grew at a rate well above the annual range set in February. 
    The pickup in M3 growth importantly reflected more rapid inflows to 
    institution-only money funds, whose yields also adjusted sluggishly to 
    falling money market rates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt had 
    grown at a rate in the upper half of its monitoring range in recent 
    months.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
    economic activity would expand sluggishly over the next few months as 
    business firms adjusted production schedules to bring inventories into 
    better alignment with sales. Subsequently, as inventory positions 
    were corrected, and with underlying support for final sales from the 
    favorable wealth and interest-cost effects of the extended rally in 
    the equity and debt markets, the economy would begin to expand at a 
    moderate pace. The forecast assumed a modest step-up in the pace of 
    consumer spending in response to some diminution of concerns about job 
    prospects and incomes as well as improved financial conditions and 
    household balance sheets. Homebuilding was projected to pick up 
    somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline in mortgage rates 
    and the related improvement in housing affordability. Business 
    outlays for new equipment were expected to slow from the very rapid 
    pace of the past few years in response to the slower growth of sales 
    and profits, but lower costs of capital and the ready availability of 
    financing would help to sustain appreciable growth in such investment. 
    Export expansion would pick up in response to some anticipated 
    strengthening in the economies of major U.S. trading partners. 
    Considerable uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook, but 
    in light of recent developments the forecast now reflected a greater 
    degree of fiscal restraint. In the staff's judgment, the prospects 
    for some easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested 
    that price inflation likely would moderate from its recently higher 
    level.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
    economic developments, members commented that the apparent pause in 
    the expansion was likely to prove temporary, and their forecasts 
    generally pointed to an upturn in overall economic activity to a pace 
    in the neighborhood of the economy's potential by the latter part of 
    this year or early 1996. Many emphasized that the prospects for a 
    strengthening economy were enhanced by the drop in intermediate- and 
    long-term interest rates and the rise in equity prices. In the view 
    of most members, however, the risks to the outlook were tilted to the 
    downside. Several stressed that the ongoing adjustments to business 
    inventories could prove to be more pronounced and of longer duration 
    than they anticipated, with negative repercussions on production and 
    incomes and in turn on consumer spending and business investment. 
    Other downside risks included the adverse implications for exports of 
    potentially less-than-projected expansion in a number of major foreign 
    economies. Nonetheless, recent developments suggested that the period 
    of maximum risk to the domestic expansion might have passed. With 
    pressures on resources having diminished and likely to ease somewhat 
    further and with labor costs remaining subdued, the risk of continuing 
    increases in inflation had fallen considerably; indeed, in the view of 
    many members inflation should moderate over the projection period.

[SECTION]

In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee 
    sets its long-run ranges for the money and debt aggregates, the 
    members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not 
    currently serving as members provided their individual projections of 
    the growth in real and nominal GDP, the rate of unemployment, and the 
    rate of inflation for the years 1995 and 1996. The forecasts of the 
    rate of expansion in real GDP for 1995 as a whole had a central 
    tendency of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, reflecting expectations of a pickup in 
    growth to a moderate pace in the second half of the year; for 1996, 
    projections of growth in real GDP centered on a range of 2-1/4 to 
    2-3/4 percent. With regard to the expansion of nominal GDP, the 
    growth forecasts were concentrated in a range of 4-1/4 to 4-3/4 
    percent for 1995 and 4-3/4 to 5-3/8 percent for 1996. The rate of 
    unemployment associated with these forecasts was expected to edge 
    higher in the second half of this year to a consensus range of 5-3/4 
    to 6-1/8 percent in the fourth quarters of both 1995 and 1996. 
    Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer 
    price index, pointed to a small decline over the projection horizon; 
    the projections converged on rates of 3-1/8 to 3-3/8 percent for 1995 
    and 2-7/8 to 3-1/4 percent for 1996.

[SECTION]

In the course of the discussion, members indicated that much 
    of the economic information that had become available since the May 
    meeting had suggested a greater softening in the economy than they had 
    anticipated and had raised concerns about the timing and strength of 
    the upturn over coming quarters. However, the most recent data and 
    some of the anecdotal reports from around the country had a better 
    tone. Among the positive factors in the economic outlook, members 
    gave particular emphasis to the favorable financial climate, including 
    the stimulative effects of lower interest rates on interest-sensitive 
    sectors of the economy, the ready availability of financing from 
    market sources and banking institutions, and the impact of rising 
    equity and bond prices on balance sheets. Business and consumer 
    sentiment also remained generally favorable, though anecdotal reports 
    suggested a heightened degree of caution among business contacts in 
    many parts of the nation. Members observed that the expansion did not 
    appear to have produced overall imbalances in the economy aside from 
    an apparent overhang of inventories in some industries. The ongoing 
    adjustments needed to bring these inventories down to desired levels 
    were seen as the most serious threat to the expansion. Some members 
    commented that the inventory correction in the second quarter appeared 
    on the basis of the available evidence to be less than was expected 
    earlier and that the period of inventory adjustment might therefore be 
    more extended in time than they had anticipated. While such a 
    development might not in itself be sufficient to tilt the economy into 
    recession, in the possible context of relatively sluggish growth in 
    final demands, the economy would be vulnerable to adverse domestic or 
    external shocks. On balance, while the timing remained uncertain, a 
    resumption of growth at a moderate rate was viewed as a likely 
    prospect, given the underlying strength of the economy.

[SECTION]

In their review of prospective developments in key sectors of 
    the economy, members noted that consumer expenditures had fallen short 
    of earlier expectations, but signs of some firming were visible, 
    notably the indications of an improvement in sales of motor vehicles 
    since early spring. While a continued sluggish performance of the 
    consumer sector could not be ruled out, the members generally expected 
    a resumption of moderate growth in consumer spending. The upturn 
    undoubtedly would be limited to some extent by the apparent exhaustion 
    of much of the earlier pent-up demands and perhaps by concerns about 
    job prospects and incomes, but the effects of reduced interest rates 
    on borrowers and the wealth effects from gains in values of financial 
    assets should help to sustain moderate growth. Moreover, if the 
    strengthening in housing activity materialized as projected, sales of 
    consumer durables would be favorably affected. While consumer 
    confidence had declined earlier, recent surveys indicated that 
    confidence had stabilized or even edged up more recently and was in 
    any event at relatively high levels in most parts of the country.

[SECTION]

Business fixed investment appeared to have moderated since 
    earlier in the year, though expenditures for both producer durable 
    equipment and nonresidential structures were still registering strong 
    gains. Further moderation was anticipated over the course of coming 
    quarters in association with slower growth in business sales and 
    decreased pressures on producer resources. While some concern was 
    expressed about the vulnerability of capital spending to a downturn in 
    the growth of sales, the members generally expected this sector of the 
    economy to remain a positive factor in the expansion. The ready 
    availability of financing on favorable terms and the ongoing need to 
    modernize equipment and other producer resources for competitive 
    reasons, notably to take advantage of continuing improvements in 
    computer and other technologies, should foster continued overall 
    growth in business investment. Members also noted that the strength 
    in business profits, though likely to moderate cyclically at some 
    point, remained a favorable factor undergirding business capital 
    spending.

[SECTION]

Housing activity had stagnated in recent months, but this 
    sector of the economy also was expected to provide some stimulus to 
    the expansion as home buyers responded to reduced mortgage rates. 
    Although the latest available data indicated that housing starts were 
    still relatively depressed, home sales and mortgage loan applications 
    for home purchases had strengthened recently. With some exceptions, 
    building industry contacts in local areas tended to confirm broader 
    indications that improvement in housing activity was occurring. 
    Members also noted that rising occupancy levels and rents should 
    support fairly robust construction of multifamily housing in many 
    areas.

[SECTION]

With regard to the outlook for fiscal policy, members gave 
    considerable emphasis to recent developments in Congress which 
    suggested that there could be greater deficit reduction over the years 
    ahead than had been built into many forecasts. The direct effects of 
    deficit cutbacks would tend to hold down the growth in final demand 
    and act as a restraining influence on overall economic activity over 
    the projection horizon. But those cutbacks also would have favorable 
    effects on financial markets, thereby stimulating to an extent 
    offsetting increases in spending. Over the longer run, deficit 
    reduction should enhance the performance and growth of the economy, 
    though monetary policy makers would need to carefully monitor possible 
    transition effects.

[SECTION]

A considerable downside risk in the view of many members was 
    the outlook for exports. Economic activity in the major foreign 
    industrial nations had been more sluggish than anticipated during the 
    first half of the year, and this raised questions about the strength 
    of the expansion in those countries and the related prospects for the 
    faster growth in U.S. exports. Most of the major economies in Latin 
    America also were projected to strengthen, and indeed such 
    expectations were reflected in financial markets, but substantial 
    problems remained that could undermine the favorable outlook. On the 
    positive side, members observed that U.S. exports were now quite 
    competitive in world markets, as evidenced by continuing gains in 
    exports to numerous countries, and such a perception was reinforced by 
    anecdotal reports of increasing foreign sales of a variety of products 
    by firms around the country. On balance, some growth in exports 
    remained a reasonable prospect but it might fall below current 
    expectations.

[SECTION]

The members generally agreed that the inflation risks in the 
    economy had diminished, though some still saw the potential for 
    little or no progress in unwinding the recent uptick in inflation. 
    Many referred to indications of easing pressures on resources in 
    recent months, and they generally felt that such pressures would be 
    contained over the projection horizon if economic growth were to 
    materialize in line with their forecasts. Developments seen as 
    consistent with such an expectation included persisting anecdotal 
    reports of highly competitive markets that made it very difficult for 
    business firms to pass on cost increases or to raise profit margins. 
    Moreover, despite continuing reports of labor scarcities in some areas 
    and industries, increases in nominal labor costs generally had 
    remained subdued across the nation. Prices of many raw materials and 
    semi-finished goods had increased sharply in earlier months and these 
    increases would continue to put upward pressure on the prices of 
    finished goods, but there recently had been signs of some abatement of 
    inflation at the earlier stages of production. Similarly, earlier 
    declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were placing 
    upward pressure on the prices of many imported products, but the 
    recent stability of the dollar promised a diminution of such pressure 
    over time. On balance, most of the members believed that the 
    underlying trend of inflation was now tilted toward gradual 
    deceleration in the context of marginally higher rates of unemployed 
    labor and other resources, but they acknowledged that the risks to 
    such an outcome remained substantial.

[SECTION]

In keeping with the requirements of the Full Employment and 
    Balanced Growth Act of 1978 (the Humphrey-Hawkins Act), the Committee 
    at this meeting reviewed the ranges for growth in the monetary and 
    debt aggregates that it had established in February for 1995 and it 
    decided on tentative ranges for growth in those aggregates in 1996. 
    The current ranges set in February for the period from the fourth 
    quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995 included expansion of 1 
    to 5 percent for M2 and 0 to 4 percent for M3. A monitoring range for 
    growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt had been set at 3 to 7 
    percent for 1995.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion, the members took account of 
    the accelerated rates of M2 and M3 growth since early spring that, for 
    the year to date, had lifted the expansion of M2 to the upper half of 
    the Committee's range and the expansion of M3 further above its 
    range. According to a staff projection, the growth of both aggregates 
    was likely to moderate over the balance of the year, assuming an 
    unchanged monetary policy, as rates paid on various components of the 
    aggregates were adjusted more fully to the reductions in market 
    interest rates that had occurred since early in the year. Even so, 
    the projected growth of the broad aggregates would remain well above 
    that experienced over the last several years. These developments 
    implied velocity behavior for these aggregates that was more in line 
    with historical patterns after several years of pronounced and 
    atypical velocity increases. The members noted that financial 
    innovations, technical changes, and deregulation had obscured 
    historical distinctions among various financial instruments and had 
    affected the extent to which holders might shift funds into or out of 
    components of the monetary aggregates in response to changing interest 
    rate patterns. As a result, substantial uncertainty remained about 
    projections of money growth and the future relationships of money and 
    debt to the basic objectives of monetary policy. Against this 
    background, members expressed somewhat differing views regarding 
    appropriate ranges for the growth of M2 and M3 in 1995 and 1996.

[SECTION]

With regard to M2, a majority of the members favored or could 
    accept a proposal to maintain the existing 1 to 5 percent range for 
    both years. These members noted that M2 growth was projected to 
    remain within the current range, though in the upper half in 1995 and 
    at the top in 1996. While recognizing that expansion at a rate above 
    that range could not be ruled out, especially for 1996, they suggested 
    that an increase in the range, at a time when substantial 
    uncertainties continued to surround the relationship of M2 to broad 
    measures of economic performance, would imply a degree of confidence 
    regarding the relationship that the Committee did not possess at this 
    point. Moreover, if the more normal behavior of velocity over the 
    past several quarters were to continue, a 1 to 5 percent range for 
    growth of M2 likely would prove consistent with the Committee's 
    ultimate objectives of sustained economic expansion and reasonable 
    price stability. There was concern that an increase in the M2 range 
    could foster a misreading of the Committee's intentions, especially if 
    some easing in policy were to be approved during this meeting, 
    explanations of the technical reasons notwithstanding.

[SECTION]

Members preferring a somewhat higher M2 range emphasized 
    that expectations for growth of this aggregate in 1995 and 1996 were 
    around the upper end of the current range. In their view, under the 
    Federal Reserve Act, the Committee's target ranges--and normally their 
    midpoints--should be consistent with the Committee's expectations for 
    growth in nominal GDP and money. From this perspective, a higher M2 
    range was clearly defensible and the reasons for it easily 
    communicated. Indeed, a failure to adjust the range upward could be 
    interpreted by observers as indicating an intent to tighten policy 
    should M2 growth remain high in relation to its current range.

[SECTION]

With regard to M3, all the members indicated that they 
    preferred or could accept an increase in its range to 2 to 6 percent 
    for both years. The current 0 to 4 percent range was quite low in 
    relation to the range for M2, judging by the average historical growth 
    of this aggregate relative to that of M2. The range had been adopted 
    in the light of unusual developments that had depressed M3 growth over 
    much of the 1990s. Those developments, which also had served to curb 
    M2 growth though to a lesser extent, involved a reduced role of 
    banking institutions in the intermediation of flows of funds between 
    savers and borrowers. That reduced role had been induced to a large 
    degree by balance sheet adjustments undertaken in response to 
    extraordinary strains experienced by banks and thrifts. Against the 
    background of favorable economic developments, the financial health of 
    depository institutions had improved markedly over the last few years, 
    and the increased ability and willingness of these institutions to 
    serve as financial intermediaries appeared to be working toward 
    strengthening the growth of M3 and lowering its velocity. In the 
    circumstances, the members believed that the contemplated increase in 
    the M3 range was essentially a technical response to developments that 
    were tending to restore both traditional financing patterns and the 
    historical pattern of somewhat faster growth in M3 than in M2. In 
    this respect, the increase in the M3 range did not have any 
    implications for the underlying thrust of monetary policy, though the 
    higher range could prove to be more consistent over time with 
    sustainable and noninflationary economic growth. As in the case of 
    the current M2 range, that conclusion assumed the eventual restoration 
    of historic relationships between M3 and measures of overall economic 
    performance.

[SECTION]

The Committee was unanimous in its view that the current 
    monitoring range for the growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt 
    should be retained for 1995 and extended to 1996. This view took into 
    account staff projections indicating that the debt aggregate was 
    likely to grow at rates well within its 3 to 7 percent range--indeed, 
    not far from the midpoint--in both years.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to 
    reaffirm the range of 1 to 5 percent for growth of M2 in 1995 and to 
    set the same range on a tentative basis for 1996:

[SECTION]

Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, 
      McDonough, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey, Melzer, 
      Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, and Ms. Phillips.

[SECTION]

Votes against this action: Mr. Blinder 
      and Ms. Yellen.

[SECTION]

Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen dissented on a technical judgment, 
    not a policy difference. They noted that if growth in the demand for 
    M2 were close to historic norms in 1995 or 1996, as indeed it had been 
    for some time, then the Committee members' projections for nominal GDP 
    would likely imply M2 growth near the top of, or even above, the 
    current range. While the relationship between the growth of M2 and 
    that of nominal GDP remained subject to a great deal of uncertainty, 
    they were persuaded that the range--in fact, the midpoint of the 
    range--should normally be consistent with members' forecasts of 
    nominal GDP growth. This would be truer to the spirit of the 
    aggregates targeting provision in the Federal Reserve Act. From this 
    perspective, they viewed a higher M2 range for 1995 and 1996 as 
    clearly preferable in communicating the Committee's objectives for the 
    economy and its expectations for money growth.

[SECTION]

The Committee then voted to raise the range for growth of M3 
    to 2 to 6 percent for 1995 and to extend that higher range 
    provisionally to 1996:

[SECTION]

Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, 
      McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey, 
      Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, and Mses. Phillips 
      and Yellen.

[SECTION]

Votes against this action: None.

[SECTION]

The Committee voted to retain the 3 to 7 percent monitoring 
    range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt for 1995 and to

These votes constituted approval of the following paragraph 
    for the directive that would be issued at the end of the meeting:

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee 
      reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established 
      on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 
      percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also 
      retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year that it had set for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range 
      for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to 
      take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 
      1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis 
      the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary 
      aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of 
      the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
      in the light of progress toward price level stability, 
      movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
      economy and financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the course of the Committee's discussion of its monetary 
    growth ranges, members commented on the failure of the monetary 
    aggregates to provide a reliable nominal anchor for the conduct of 
    monetary policy in recent years. Moreover, the restoration of 
    historic relationships, or the emergence of new but stable 
    relationships, between money growth and measures of progress toward 
    broad economic objectives could not be predicted with any degree of 
    confidence. Some members expressed the view that in these 
    circumstances the Committee needed to continue to look at potential 
    alternative approaches to guide the formulation of policy and to 
    communicate its intentions to the public, especially with respect to 
    the Committee's objective of promoting price stability over time.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
    period ahead, nearly all the members indicated that they favored or 
    could support a proposal to ease slightly the current degree of 
    pressure on reserve positions. Preferences for an unchanged policy 
    stance and for somewhat greater easing also were expressed. In 
    support of at least slight easing, members commented that they viewed 
    current monetary policy as somewhat restrictive, judged in part by the 
    level of the inflation-adjusted federal funds rate. This degree of 
    monetary restraint had been appropriate early in the year when the 
    economy was operating at or possibly beyond its long-run potential and 
    inflation pressures appeared to be mounting. Some modest easing was 
    desirable now that the growth of the economy had slowed considerably 
    more than anticipated and potential inflationary pressures seemed to 
    be in the process of receding. Although inflation was higher than in 
    1994 and the economy was still operating at an elevated level, looking 
    forward many members saw prospects for declining inflation and the 
    possibility of shortfalls in economic growth. The members agreed that 
    under present economic conditions a slight easing of the stance of 
    policy would incur little risk of stimulating increased inflation and 
    would be entirely consistent with their commitment to continued 
    progress toward price stability over time. Several members also 
    observed that any move toward less restraint should be cautious at 
    this point because easing would represent a change in the direction of 
    policy and its repercussions on financial markets, including the 
    foreign exchange markets, could be relatively pronounced.

[SECTION]

A few members preferred somewhat greater easing. They 
    stressed that such a move was warranted by the recent pause in the 
    expansion and the apparent vulnerability of the economy to a variety 
    of downside risks. Indeed, a move from what they saw as a restrictive 
    monetary policy toward a more neutral policy stance was somewhat 
    overdue in their view. While they could support a slight adjustment 
    to policy at this point, these members were persuaded that the stance 
    of monetary policy probably would need to be eased by more than a 
    slight amount over time to accommodate the intermediate- and long-term 
    needs of an expanding economy. Moreover, the risks of increasing 
    inflationary pressures appeared to be relatively remote in the context 
    of the current and anticipated performance of the overall economy. 
    The declines in intermediate- and long-term interest rates were 
    helping to support the expansion, but those declines rested in part on 
    market expectations of significant monetary policy easing; failure to 
    ratify such expectations could well result in at least a partial 
    reversal of those desirably lower rates.

[SECTION]

Members who leaned toward an unchanged policy remained 
    concerned about the persistence of inflationary pressures and whether 
    a somewhat easier policy stance would be consistent with the objective 
    of capping inflation and setting the stage for further progress toward 
    price stability. The available evidence on the economy's current 
    performance remained mixed and most forecasts pointed to moderate 
    strengthening ahead; in the circumstances an easing move did not 
    appear to be needed at this time. One member emphasized that, 
    while the risks of greater inflation seemed small, the costs of a 
    policy error in the direction of too much easing would be high in 
    terms of its effects on the credibility of the System's anti-inflationary policy and the need to rein in inflationary growth next 
    year. Although their preference would be to wait for further evidence 
    on the performance of the economy, all but one of these members 
    indicated that, given the current uncertainties surrounding the 
    economic outlook and the small amount of easing that was proposed, 
    they would not dissent from the majority position.

[SECTION]

With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the 
    intermeeting period, most of the members who favored some easing also 
    preferred an asymmetric directive, including a marked preference on 
    the part of those who supported greater easing than the majority. An 
    asymmetric directive was consistent with the view shared by most 
    members that the risks to the expansion were biased to the downside, 
    but no member expressed a strong presumption about the likely need to 
    ease policy during the weeks ahead. The Committee would, of course, 
    monitor and respond as needed to the incoming economic information.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's discussion, all but one 
    of the members indicated that they favored or could support a 
    directive that called for some slight easing in the degree of pressure 
    on reserve positions and that included a bias toward possible further 
    easing of reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. 
    Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful 
    consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the 
    Committee decided that somewhat greater monetary restraint might be 
    acceptable or somewhat lesser monetary restraint would be acceptable 
    during the intermeeting period. According to a staff analysis, the 
    reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting would be consistent 
    with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
    New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
    the Committee, to execute transactions in the System account in 
    accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
      that the level of economic activity was about unchanged 
      in the second quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment fell 
      in April and May after posting reduced gains in the 
      first quarter, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 
      5.7 percent in May, was up somewhat from its first-quarter average. Industrial production continued to 
      decline in May, reflecting another cutback in the 
      production of motor vehicles, and capacity utilization 
      was down somewhat further. Total retail sales have 
      been sluggish on average in recent months. Housing 
      starts were about unchanged over April and May, but 
      sales of new homes turned up sharply in May. Orders 
      for nondefense capital goods have moderated somewhat in 
      recent months but still point to considerable further 
      expansion of spending on business equipment; nonresidential construction has continued to trend 
      appreciably higher. The nominal deficit on U.S. trade 
      in goods and services widened in April from its average 
      rate in the first quarter. Broad indexes of consumer 
      and producer prices have increased faster on average 
      thus far this year, though there were signs of some 
      moderation in the most recent data; advances in labor 
      compensation costs have remained subdued.

[SECTION]

Most interest rates have declined somewhat further 
      since the Committee meeting on May 23. In foreign 
      exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the 
      dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies declined 
      considerably over the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

M2 and M3 strengthened substantially in May and 
      June. For the year through June, M2 expanded at a rate 
      in the upper half of its range for 1995 and M3 grew at 
      a rate well above its range. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has grown at a rate in the upper half of 
      its monitoring range in recent months.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
      and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
      furtherance of these objectives, the Committee 
      reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established 
      on January 31-February 1 for growth of M2 of 1 to 5 
      percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1994 to 
      the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee also 
      retained the monitoring range of 3 to 7 percent for the 
      year that it had set for growth of total domestic 
      nonfinancial debt. The Committee raised the 1995 range 
      for M3 to 2 to 6 percent as a technical adjustment to 
      take account of changing intermediation patterns. For 
      1996, the Committee established on a tentative basis 
      the same ranges as in 1995 for growth of the monetary 
      aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter 
      of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. The behavior of 
      the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated 
      in the light of progress toward price level stability, 
      movements in their velocities, and developments in the 
      economy and financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
      future, the Committee seeks to decrease slightly the 
      existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In 
      the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
      price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
      giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
      and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
      restraint might or slightly lesser reserve restraint 
      would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
      contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
      consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over 
      coming months.

Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,

[SECTION]

Vote against this action: Mr. Hoenig.

[SECTION]

Mr. Hoenig dissented because he believed the stance of 
    monetary policy should remain unchanged at this time. With the pace 
    of economic activity likely to return to trend growth later this year 
    and inflation expected to be higher this year and next than in 1994, 
    he felt an unchanged policy in the near term would enhance the 
    prospects of achieving the Committee's long-run objectives of 
    sustainable economic growth and price stability.

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would
