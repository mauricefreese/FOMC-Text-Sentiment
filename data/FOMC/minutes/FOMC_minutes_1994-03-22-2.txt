  meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee held on February 3-4, 
  1994, were approved.

[SECTION]

The Manager for Foreign Operations reported on developments

[SECTION]

The Manager for Domestic Operations reported on developments 
  in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions 
  in government securities and federal agency obligations during the

  the Committee ratified these transactions.

[SECTION]

By unanimous vote, paragraph l(a) of the Authorization for 
  Domestic Open Market Operations was amended to raise from $8 billion 
  to $11 billion the dollar limit on intermeeting changes in System 
  Account holdings of U.S. government and federal agency securities for 
  the intermeeting period ending with the close of business on May 17, 
  1994.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and 
  financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the 
  intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and financial 
  information available at the time of the meeting and of the 
  Committee's discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic 
  policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the 
  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that 
  economic activity had expanded appreciably further in the early months 
  of 1994, despite unusually severe winter weather. Consumer spending 
  and construction activity had been held down to some extent by the 
  adverse weather conditions, but motor vehicle production had continued 
  at a very strong pace and business fixed investment appeared to be 
  headed for a significant gain in the first quarter. Factory 
  utilization rates had moved still higher, and labor demand seemed to 
  have grown moderately further. Outside of a surge in energy prices, 
  increases in broad indexes of consumer and producer prices remained 
  moderate.

[SECTION]

Nonfarm payroll employment was unchanged in January but 
  posted a February advance comparable to the sizable monthly increases 
  recorded in the final quarter of 1993. Employment in the service 
  industries declined slightly in January, then rebounded substantially 
  in February. Manufacturing payrolls rose in January and February, but 
  the number of jobs in construction declined in both months, reflecting 
  that industry's vulnerability to weather disruptions. The civilian 
  unemployment rate, calculated on the new basis, fell to 6.5 percent in 
  February: however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics cautioned that a 
  variety of technical factors might have exaggerated the decline in 
  joblessness in early 1994.

[SECTION]

After a sharp rise in the fourth quarter, industrial 
  production increased considerably further in January and February. 
  Manufacturing output continued to rise, despite the apparent damping 
  effect of adverse weather on a number of industries. Assemblies of 
  motor vehicles remained quite buoyant, accounting for more than half 
  of the increase in manufacturing production in the first two months of 
  the year and reaching in February their highest level since the late 
  1970s. Production of manufactured goods other than motor vehicles 
  also was up in the two months, but the advances were smaller than 
  those of late 1993. Output of utilities surged in-January, reflecting 
  the heating demand resulting from abnormally cold temperatures, but 
  a portion of that gain was retraced in February. Total utilization of 
  industrial capacity increased in both January and February and was at 
  relatively elevated levels, judged by historical norms; operating 
  rates in primary processing industries were especially high.

[SECTION]

Retail sales were little changed on balance over the first 
  two months of the year, with sales recovering in February from a large 
  January decline. By contrast, sales of motor vehicles remained quite 
  brisk on average over the two months, despite the California 
  earthquake and the severe weather. Soaring outlays for home heating 
  contributed to rapid growth of consumer spending on services in 
  January. The unusual weather also affected housing activity; starts 
  were down considerably in January and February from the very high 
  levels of late 1993, and new home sales plunged in January. Sales of 
  existing homes in January were only slightly below their high December 
  level.

[SECTION]

The limited available evidence pointed to a noticeably 
  smaller gain in business fixed investment in the first quarter of 1994 
  after a very large increase in the previous quarter. Shipments of 
  nondefense capital goods slowed in January, retracing part of the 
  sharp rise of the fourth quarter, but the buoyancy of orders in recent 
  months pointed to a further increase in shipments in coming months. 
  Sales of heavy trucks were strong in January, and the backlog of 
  orders for such vehicles remained large. Nonresidential construction 
  activity, perhaps owing in part to bad weather, was down in January 
  after trending up over most of 1993. The largest decline was in 
  office building, which had posted large increases in the preceding two 
  months.

[SECTION]

Business inventories fell slightly in January, and stocks 
  were lean, especially at manufacturing firms. Inventories in 
  manufacturing rose, retracing in January part of a large December 
  decline; much of the January increase was at producers of machinery, where stocks had fallen to very low levels relative to shipments. At 
  both the wholesale and retail levels, inventories posted sizable 
  decreases. In the wholesale sector, the inventory-to-sales ratio 
  edged down and had changed little since May of last year. The 
  inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector was up slightly, 
  reflecting weak sales in January.

[SECTION]

The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services, 
  measured on the new balance-of-payments basis, was slightly smaller in 
  January than the average for the fourth quarter. However, the January 
  deficit was substantially larger than that of December, with exports 
  down by more than imports. Much of the reduction in exports was in 
  agricultural goods, aircraft, and gold; the drop in imports mainly 
  reflected both lower quantities and lower prices of imported oil. The 
  limited available data suggested that economic activity in the major 
  foreign industrial countries picked up in early 1994 after a mixed 
  performance in the fourth quarter of 1993.

[SECTION]

Producer prices of finished goods were boosted in February by 
  a surge in energy prices, especially for gasoline and heating oil, 
  that more than offset a further decline in food prices. Excluding the 
  food and energy components, producer prices edged higher in February: 
  for the twelve months ended in February, producer prices increased by 
  a significantly smaller amount than in the twelve-month period ended 
  in February 1993. At the consumer level, higher energy prices in 
  February were offset by lower food prices. For items other than food 
  and energy, consumer prices also rose less over the twelve months 
  ended in February than in the previous twelve months. Average hourly 
  earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased more slowly 
  in February, but for the twelve months ended in February, the advance 
  was about the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months.

[SECTION]

At its meeting on February 3-4, 1994, the Committee adopted a 
  directive that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure 
  on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the 
  likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting 
  period. The directive stated that in the context of the Committee's 
  long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic 
  growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and 
  monetary developments, slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve 
  restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. The 
  reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be 
  consistent with moderate growth of M2 and M3 over the first half of 
  1994.

[SECTION]

Immediately following the February meeting, Chairman 
  Greenspan announced the Committee's decision, and open market 
  operations were directed toward implementing the slightly less 
  accommodative degree of reserve pressures sought by the Committee. 
  The federal funds rate increased by 1/4 percentage point and then 
  remained close to 3-1/4 percent over the intermeeting period, while 
  adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged a little less than 
  anticipated.

[SECTION]

Most other market interest rates rose considerably more than 
  the federal funds rate in frequently volatile markets. Market 
  participants generally had anticipated a tightening of monetary 
  policy, but the Committee's action apparently came a little sooner 
  than had been expected. Strong fourth-quarter economic data and 
  evidence of solid growth in early 1994 were seen as suggesting greater 
  credit demands and the need for higher interest rates in the future to 
  contain inflation. Heightened trade tensions and unsettled market 
  conditions abroad also contributed to market concerns. In these 
  circumstances, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates increased 
  by appreciably more than short-term money market rates. Major indexes 
  of stock prices had fallen on balance since early February in 
  sometimes volatile trading.

[SECTION]

The trade-weighted value of the dollar in terms of the other 
  G-10 currencies initially rose following the tightening of monetary 
  policy on February 4. The dollar depreciated over the balance of the 
  intermeeting period, however, despite higher U.S. interest rates and 
  the release of data indicating generally strong U.S. economic 
  activity. The dollar declined against both the Japanese yen and the 
  German mark, trade frictions between the United States and Japan and 
  disappointment over the pace of monetary easing in Germany appeared to 
  be contributing factors in the depreciation of the dollar. Bond 
  yields in all the major foreign industrial countries rose on average 
  by almost as much as yields on comparable U.S. bonds.

[SECTION]

M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in February. A 
  substantial drop in mortgage refinancings since late 1993 that 
  depressed demand deposits, and to a lesser extent savings deposits, contributed to the weakness of M2 in February. M3 also was affected 
  by a precipitous decline in institution-only money funds as investors 
  reacted quickly following the monetary tightening to widening spreads 
  between returns on these funds and higher-yielding short-term 
  instruments. Data for early March pointed to some rebound in both 
  monetary aggregates, perhaps owing to portfolio readjustments that 
  involved sizable net redemptions of bond funds and apparently-weaker 
  inflows to stock funds. Total domestic nonfinancial debt expanded at 
  a moderate rate in recent months.

[SECTION]

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that 
  economic expansion would slow from the very strong pace of the fourth 
  quarter but that the economy would advance in 1994 at a rate slightly 
  in excess of the growth of potential. Consumer spending, which had 
  tended for some time to outpace income growth, was projected to 
  increase at a rate more in line with disposable incomes; spending on 
  durable goods, in particular, was projected to slow markedly as stock-adjustment motives diminished and higher interest rates exerted some 
  restraint. Business fixed investment was expected to increase less 
  rapidly in 1994, reflecting the diminishing effect of the earlier 
  pickup in output growth and the slower growth of corporate cash flow. 
  Homebuilding activity was anticipated to continue at a relatively 
  brisk pace, spurred by the greater cash-flow affordability of housing 
  and the good prospects for continued growth in employment and incomes. 
  The restraint on output growth from federal spending cutbacks and weak 
  export demand was projected to diminish somewhat. In light of the 
  limited margins of slack in labor and product markets that were 
  expected to prevail over the forecast horizon, little further 
  reduction in the core rate of inflation was expected.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective 
  economic developments, members referred to widespread indications of 
  appreciable momentum in the economic expansion and decreasing margins 
  of unemployed labor and other producer resources. While the members 
  continued to anticipate a marked slowing in economic growth from the 
  very rapid pace of the fourth quarter, some commented that despite 
  unusually severe winter weather in large parts of the country the 
  deceleration in the current quarter appeared to be less than they had 
  expected. The indications of continuing strength in aggregate demand 
  along with a still-accommodative monetary policy suggested a much 
  reduced risk that the economic expansion would stall. Indeed, members 
  continued to expect moderate economic growth, though perhaps for a 
  time at a rate somewhat above the economy's potential. The amount of 
  resources that could be mobilized readily to meet this demand was 
  subject to substantial uncertainty, but the degree of slack in the 
  economy clearly had diminished considerably in recent quarters to 
  relatively low levels and likely would shrink further. The immediate 
  outlook for inflation remained favorable: costs and prices were being 
  contained by moderate wage increases, continuing pressures for 
  productivity-enhancing investment, and competitive prices from abroad 
  where slack was still quite ample; and broad measures of money and 
  credit, though strengthening over the last half of 1993, remained 
  moderate by historical standards. Nevertheless, looking ahead, 
  members were concerned that, unless monetary policy were adjusted 
  further from its still-accommodative stance, pressures on resources 
  would intensify and inflation would pick up.

[SECTION]

Members assessed the outlook for economic activity and prices 
  against the backdrop of sharp changes in bond and, to a lesser extent, 
  equity prices over the intermeeting period. Clearly, the tightening 
  of reserve conditions announced on February 4 had played a role in 
  market movements, but other factors had been at work as well. Members 
  variously stressed the possibility that the backup in interest rates 
  had reflected much stronger aggregate demand, added uncertainty about 
  the course of interest rates, influences from foreign exchange and 
  foreign capital markets, changes in trading strategies by wary 
  participants, and rising inflation expectations. On balance, 
  financial conditions were still seen as supportive of solid economic 
  expansion, and a number of members referred in particular to the more 
  accommodative lending policies of many depository institutions; 
  however, some commented on the risk, which they viewed as having a low 
  probability, that weakness and volatility in financial markets could 
  at some point have a significantly inhibiting effect on business and 
  consumer confidence and spending. To date, business sentiment was 
  described as quite positive in most parts of the country, and although 
  there were some exceptions--notably in California--members commented 
  on numerous indications of improving regional economies.

[SECTION]

A number of members observed that they expected consumer 
  spending to be relatively well maintained, buttressed by considerable 
  strength in expenditures for motor vehicles and other consumer 
  durables. Reports on retail sales from various parts of the country 
  tended to support such assessments, and many contacts among retailers 
  were expressing optimism about the outlook for their sales. At the 
  same time, some members observed that a number of factors were likely 
  to limit the potential strength of consumer spending. They referred 
  in particular to the already low saving rate, relatively high consumer 
  indebtedness, and recent declines in the value of securities held by 
  households. More importantly, however, consumer confidence and 
  spending would continue to depend heavily on the outlook for further 
  growth in employment and incomes.

[SECTION]

Business investment expenditures remained on a solid uptrend 
  as firms continued to focus on the need to control costs and improve 
  operating efficiencies in the face of vigorous competitive pressures. 
  Members also cited some examples of investment spending induced by 
  rising demands pressing against limitations in production capacity. 
  While business investment had tended to be concentrated in new, more 
  productive equipment, nonresidential construction also had 
  strengthened and anecdotal reports from numerous areas tended to 
  confirm more positive nationwide statistics. The rising levels of 
  nonresidential construction activity tended to be concentrated in 
  commercial and industrial facilities and public works projects; the 
  construction of office buildings continued to lag but this sector 
  appeared to have stabilized or perhaps improved marginally after a 
  long period of decline. More generally, currently positive business 
  attitudes augured well for further growth in overall business 
  investment, but on the negative side it was noted that further 
  turbulence in financial markets could erode confidence with adverse 
  implications for investment spending. Residential construction was 
  described as quite strong in numerous areas, although overall housing 
  construction had been held down thus far this year by severe winter 
  weather in numerous parts of the country. Shortages of skilled 
  construction workers and building materials were reported in many 
  areas.

[SECTION]

Despite generally rising final demands, business firms were 
  continuing to maintain lean inventory positions in their ongoing 
  efforts to hold down costs. Nonetheless, with production levels in 
  many industries approaching or reaching full capacity utilization, 
  prices of some materials and other business purchases coming under 
  increasing pressure, and delivery lead times tending to lengthen at 
  least in some industries, efforts to build inventories could be 
  expected to materialize and in one view the potential for such a 
  development represented a key upside risk from current forecasts. In 
  this connection, some members referred to scattered indications of 
  efforts to increase inventories, notably of steel products. 
  Manufacturers of motor vehicles also were in the process of rebuilding 
  depleted inventories, though the currently stimulative impact of such 
  rebuilding on overall production was likely to be reversed when motor 
  vehicle stocks reached desired levels in the months ahead.

[SECTION]

The foreign trade sector was expected to remain a negative 
  factor in the economic outlook. However, the members anticipated some 
  improvement in the economies of major foreign industrial nations 
  which, together with some moderation in the growth of domestic final 
  demands, was likely to slow the decline in real net exports. A few 
  members cited growing indications that last year's NAFTA legislation 
  would have quite positive effects on U.S. foreign trade, though those 
  effects were still largely in the future.

[SECTION]

In the discussion of the outlook for prices and wages, many 
  of the members expressed concern about the potential for a pickup in 
  inflation if, as they anticipated, margins of unemployed resources 
  narrowed further or disappeared. The members acknowledged that broad 
  measures of prices relating to final purchases and of wages currently 
  did not suggest any increase in inflation. Indeed, in the view of at 
  least some members, those measures still suggested on balance that the 
  inflation trend had retained a downward tilt thus far. In this 
  connection, some commented that the overall performance of the broad 
  measures had been somewhat better in recent months than they had 
  anticipated, especially given the very rapid expansion of the economy 
  over the closing months of 1993 and the less than expected moderation 
  thus far this year. Developments that had been exerting a favorable 
  effect on prices included above-trend growth in productivity, 
  relatively low prices in world oil markets, and strong competition in 
  many markets from both domestic and foreign firms. Moreover, the 
  strong rise in credit usage that often had accompanied intensified 
  inflation pressures in the past had yet to materialize. To date, the 
  pickup in price increases had been uneven and had tended to be 
  concentrated in some regions or industries and in the early stages of 
  the production process, and a number of members reported that they saw 
  little change in inflation trends in their areas. Nonetheless, 
  warning signs had emerged of the prospect of greater inflation, though 
  perhaps not over the nearer term. These included increases in a wide 
  range of commodity prices and anecdotal reports from various parts of 
  the country suggesting a further rise in the number of business firms 
  that were facing somewhat higher prices of materials and other 
  purchases and in turn were able, often for the first time in recent 
  years, to raise their selling prices. Price and wage pressures 
  appeared to be especially pronounced in the construction industry, 
  where capacity constraints had been encountered in many localities. 
  Members also referred to the potential for higher prices in the food 
  and energy sectors; low crop carryovers for some grains made food 
  prices vulnerable to unfavorable growing conditions, should they 
  materialize; oil prices currently were at relative lows but were 
  likely to come under some upward pressures as world economic growth 
  accelerated and if political developments led to disruptions in world 
  supplies. More fundamentally, the relatively robust economic 
  expansion over the second half of 1993 and the further advance in 
  early 1994 appeared in the view of many members to have appreciably 
  diminished the gap between actual and potential GDP and to have 
  reduced the rate of unemployment to a level that could well be not far 
  from the natural rate. If this assessment proved to be correct, 
  further economic expansion at a pace above the economy's potential 
  would bring more industries and the economy more generally to capacity 
  production levels before very long and could well-generate growing 
  inflation thereafter.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting 
  period ahead, all the members supported a further move toward a less 
  accommodative policy stance. An initial move in that direction had 
  been made in early February, but the members still viewed monetary 
  policy as too stimulative. In this regard, members cited the very low 
  inflation-adjusted interest rates in short-term debt markets as an 
  indicator of excessive policy accommodation, and one member also 
  referred to the rapid growth in reserves and narrow measures of money 
  over an extended period. While a quite accommodative policy stance 
  had been entirely appropriate earlier in the economic recovery, when 
  constraints such as the widespread rebuilding of balance sheets and 
  business restructuring activities were strongly inhibiting the 
  expansionary forces in the economy, those constraints had greatly 
  diminished and the expansion clearly had gained considerable momentum. 
  In the circumstances, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy 
  could be expected before too long to foster growing pressures on labor 
  and capital resources with a resulting pickup in inflation. While 
  actual inflation remained subdued and credit growth was still damped, 
  it was only a matter of time before the current monetary policy 
  induced a surge in credit extensions that could fuel an outbreak of 
  inflation.

[SECTION]

In these circumstances, the members concluded that monetary 
  policy needed to move fairly quickly toward what might be characterized as a more neutral position. Such a policy posture could not be 
  defined with precision and it undoubtedly varied to some extent with 
  changing circumstances. Nonetheless, it provided a useful conceptual 
  approach to policy in current circumstances and could be identified as 
  a policy stance that sought to foster sustained noninflationary 
  expansion consistent with the economy's potential. The members 
  generally concluded that such a policy stance was still some distance 
  away, and the key issue facing the Committee was not whether but how 
  promptly the necessary policy adjustment should be completed. Whether 
  further tightening beyond that point would be needed later could not 
  be determined at this time but would depend on the potential emergence 
  of conditions pointing to an acceleration of inflation.

[SECTION]

As had been the case at the February meeting, views differed 
  on how much further current monetary policy should be adjusted at this 
  meeting. Many members noted that money market interest rates would 
  have to rise by a relatively sizable amount from current levels, given 
  underlying economic conditions, but a majority indicated a preference 
  for another small move at this time. Many were concerned about a 
  possible overreaction in financial markets that had become quite 
  sensitive and volatile since early February. A few also placed some 
  emphasis on their expectations of a considerable slowdown in the rate 
  of economic growth and the possibility that the moderation of the 
  expansion might prove to be somewhat more pronounced than was 
  currently projected. In this view, a degree of caution was advisable 
  to permit an assessment of ongoing developments.

[SECTION]

Members who preferred a more sizable policy adjustment, or 
  perhaps a small move through open market operations that was 
  associated with a rise in the discount rate, believed that the 
  increasing risks of greater inflation pointed to the need to move more 
  promptly and decisively away from a policy stance that had become 
  overly accommodative. A stronger policy action at this point would 
  serve to underscore the Committee's commitment to its price stability 
  objective and would help to counteract what some members interpreted 
  as a significant increase in inflationary expectations since earlier 
  in the year. A reduction in such expectations would over time have 
  beneficial implications for bond markets and the economy. In the view 
  of some members, continued market expectations of further actions to 
  tighten reserve conditions were themselves contributing to market 
  instability. Some members also commented that any policy choice 
  incurred the risk of proving to be wrong, but they viewed the greatest 
  risk at this juncture to be a policy that allowed inflationary 
  pressures to gather momentum. A policy decision that in hindsight led 
  to the implementation of too much restraint could be corrected more 
  readily and with less damage to the economy in this view.

[SECTION]

In the Committee's discussion of possible intermeeting 
  adjustments to the degree of reserve pressure, a majority of the 
  members indicated a preference for retaining a symmetric directive. 
  While the probability of an easing action during this period was 
  deemed to be very low, the members also did not see as very likely any 
  firming over the intermeeting period beyond that to be implemented 
  after today's meeting. The Committee had embarked on a course of 
  moving away from an accommodative stance toward one that was more 
  neutral. The timing of the actions to implement this policy was not 
  independent of the behavior of the economy, of course, but it was not 
  as dependent on the nuances of incoming data as policy might be at 
  other times when the course of policy was less clear. Symmetry did 
  not rule out an intermeeting adjustment of policy by the Chairman on 
  behalf of the Committee, as had been done with some frequency in the 
  past when that seemed warranted by intermeeting developments. Members 
  who favored an asymmetric directive observed that such a directive 
  seemed more consistent with the current thrust of monetary policy 
  toward less accommodation and the related need to respond promptly to 
  indications of accelerating inflation. These members indicated, 
  however, that they could support a symmetric directive that was 
  associated with the prospect of intermeeting consultations.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the Committee's policy discussion, all 
  but two of the members indicated that they could accept a directive 
  that called for a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve 
  positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely 
  direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period. 
  Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
  price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful 
  consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the 
  Committee decided that slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve 
  restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period. 
  According to a staff analysis, the reserve conditions contemplated at 
  this meeting would be consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 
  over the first half of 1994.

[SECTION]

At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
  New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by 
  the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in 
  accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

[SECTION]

The information reviewed at this meeting suggests 
    that economic activity has expanded appreciably further 
    in the early months of 1994. Severe weather and 
    changes in statistical methodology distorted movements 
    in official labor market data in January and February, 
    but it appears that employment increased somewhat on 
    balance over the two months and that unemployment fell. 
    Industrial production also increased substantially over 
    this period after a sharp rise in the fourth quarter. 
    Consumer spending and housing activity apparently have 
    been held down to some extent by adverse weather in 
    January and February: retail sales were little changed 
    on balance over the two months and housing starts fell 
    considerably. Trends in contracts and orders point to 
    a sizable increase in business fixed investment but at 
    a rate well below that for the fourth quarter of 1993. 
    The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services 
    in January was slightly smaller than the average in the 
    fourth quarter. Increases in broad indexes of consumer 
    and producer prices have remained moderate in recent 
    months despite a surge in energy prices.

[SECTION]

Most market interest rates have risen considerably 
    since the Committee meeting on February 3-4, 1994. In 
    foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of 
    the dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies 
    depreciated over the intermeeting period.

[SECTION]

M2 declined somewhat and M3 was down sharply in 
    February, but data for early March point to some 
    rebound in both aggregates. Total domestic nonfinancial debt has expanded at a moderate rate in recent 
    months.

[SECTION]

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary 
    and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In 
    furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its 
    meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 
    and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1993 to the 
    fourth quarter of 1994. The Committee anticipated that 
    developments contributing to unusual velocity increases 
    could persist during the year and that money growth 
    within these ranges would be consistent with its broad 
    policy objectives. The monitoring range for growth of 
    total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 4 to 8 
    percent for the year. The behavior of the monetary 
    aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light 
    of progress toward price level stability, movements in 
    their velocities, and developments in the economy and 
    financial markets.

[SECTION]

In the implementation of policy for the immediate 
    future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the 
    existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In 
    the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for 
    price stability and sustainable economic growth, and 
    giving careful consideration to economic, financial, 
    and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve 
    restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be 
    acceptable in the intermeeting period. The 
    contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be 
    consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over the 
    first half of 1994.

[SECTION]

Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, 
    McDonough, Forrestal, Kelley, LaWare, Lindsey, 
    Parry, and Ms. Phillips.

[SECTION]

Votes against this action: Messrs. Broaddus, 
    and Jordan.

[SECTION]

Messrs. Broaddus and Jordan dissented because they preferred 
  a stronger move toward a more neutral policy stance. In their view, 
  the recent sharp increases in longer-term interest rates indicated 
  clearly that inflationary expectations were rising and that the 
  principal policy risk had become one of remaining accommodative for 
  too long a period. In this environment, they believed that a more 
  aggressive move would underscore the Committee's commitment to 
  fostering sustainable longer-term growth and reduce the risk that a 
  highly restrictive policy might be required at a later date to contain 
  inflation.

[SECTION]

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the desirability 
  of making an immediate announcement of today's policy decision. All 
  the members favored prompt disclosure in principle, but some expressed 
  reservations about announcing today's decision immediately after the 
  meeting. These members preferred to consider a decision on 
  announcements of policy actions in the context of a broad range of 
  disclosure issues, some of which had yet to be fully explored. Some 
  stressed that they remained concerned about the inhibiting effects of 
  some types of disclosures on the Committee's deliberations, and one 
  member emphasized that the Committee also needed to consider the 
  implications of immediate announcements of changes in open market 
  policy for the role of the discount rate. Several members commented 
  that announcing a decision reached at this meeting, because it would 
  come after a similar announcement following the most recent meeting in 
  early February, would in effect set a precedent that would tend to 
  limit the Committee's future options. A majority of the members 
  concluded, however, that while the Committee was not making a formal, binding decision on this issue at this meeting, the Chairman would be 
  authorized to release a short press statement regarding today's policy 
  decision. A useful purpose would be served in reducing or eliminating 
  potential misinterpretation of the Committee's policy decision and the 
  related risk of overreactions in financial markets at a time of 
  considerable uncertainty and volatility in those markets. The news of 
  the Committee's action would be conveyed unambiguously to the entire 
  public at once and not filtered through the financial markets' 
  interpretation of open market operations. Moreover, the Committee 
  would retain the option of specifying the exact contents and timing of 
  future policy announcements, including intermeeting policy actions. 
  Most of the members concluded that the advantages to the public of 
  prompt release today outweighed the potential disadvantages.

[SECTION]

It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be 
  held on Tuesday, May 17. 1994. This meeting adjourned at 2:05 p.m.

[SECTION]

At a telephone conference held on March 24, 1994, the 
  Committee approved a temporary increase, from $700 million to $3.0 
  billion, in the Federal Reserve System's reciprocal currency ("swap") 
  arrangement with the Bank of Mexico. Concurrently, the U.S. Treasury 
  announced a $3 billion swap arrangement between the U.S. Exchange 
  Stabilization Fund and the Bank of Mexico and the Mexican Ministry of 
  Finance. The System's action was effective immediately and. subject 
  to certain conditions, it authorized the Bank of Mexico to draw on the 
  enlarged arrangement until April 29, 1994, with full repayment of any 
  drawings to be made by July 29, 1994.

[SECTION]

A permanent increase in the System's swap arrangement with 
  the Bank of Mexico had been discussed at the Committee's recent 
  meeting on March 22, and it had been contemplated at that meeting that 
  the Committee would vote on such an increase during April in the 
  context of the establishment of a consultative mechanism involving the 
  finance ministries and central banks of Canada, Mexico, and the United 
  States. However, the assassination of a major candidate for the 
  presidency of Mexico on the evening of March 23 had prompted the 
  closing of Mexican financial markets on March 24 and had given rise to 
  concerns regarding possible financial market disorder in reaction to 
  unfolding political developments when those markets reopened. Against 
  this background, the Committee decided to join the U.S. Treasury in an 
  action that would help confirm continued U.S. support for Mexico's 
  economic policies at a potentially critical time for Mexican financial 
  markets.

[SECTION]

Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, 
    McDonough, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare, 
    Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.

[SECTION]

Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.

[SECTION]

Effective April 26, 1994, the Committee by notation vote 
  approved a recommendation by Chairman Greenspan to establish an 
  enlarged swap arrangement of $3 billion on a permanent basis. As is 
  the case for all swap arrangements, this arrangement is subject to 
  periodic annual review after an initial maturity date of December 15, 
  1995. Simultaneously, the maturity date of the System's swap facility 
  with the Bank of Canada was extended by one year to December 15, 1995.

[SECTION]

Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan, 
    McDonough, Forrestal, Jordan, Kelley, LaWare, 
    Lindsey, Parry, and Ms. Phillips.

[SECTION]

Vote against this action: Mr. Broaddus.

[SECTION]

The enlarged foreign exchange swap arrangement with the Bank 
  of Mexico constituted part of a new trilateral foreign exchange swap 
  facility established in connection with the newly formed consultative 
  group called the North American Financial Group and comprised of the 
  Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of Canada, Mexico, and 
  the United States. The purpose of this standing facility is to expand 
  the pool of potential resources available to the monetary authorities 
  of each country to maintain orderly exchange markets. Its 
  establishment at this time was deemed desirable in light of the 
  outlook for expanding and increasingly interdependent economic 
  relationships among the three economies following the successful 
  conclusion of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

[SECTION]

The components of the trilateral facility include (1) swap 
  agreements between the United States and Mexico for up to $6.0 
  billion, with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve each participating 
  up to $3.0 billion; (2) an expansion of the swap agreement between the 
  Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico to CAN$1.0 billion; and (3) a 
  reaffirmation of the existing swap agreement between the Bank of 
  Canada and the Federal Reserve in the amount of $2.0 billion, with the 
  above-noted maturity extension.

[SECTION]

Mr. Broaddus dissented because he was concerned about the 
  appropriateness of the System's involvement in this type of foreign 
  currency operation. In his view, the System's swap network raised a 
  number of broad issues that he felt the Committee needed to review at 
  some point. Accordingly, he would not favor increasing any existing 
  swap arrangement until such a review had taken place.

[SECTION]

At a telephone conference on April 18, Committee members 
  reviewed economic and financial developments since the March meeting 
  and discussed the desirability of taking further action to move policy 
  away from its still accommodative stance. Broad indicators of 
  economic activity, supported by widespread anecdotal evidence, pointed 
  to considerable momentum in economic activity and further reductions 
  in already limited margins of unutilized labor and other production 
  resources. In financial markets, sharp declines in bond and stock 
  prices suggested that speculative excesses had been reduced, and 
  ongoing portfolio realignments probably were shifting long-term 
  financial assets to firmer hands. As a result, financial markets now 
  appeared to be less likely to overreact to adverse developments or to 
  policy actions. In the circumstances, the members supported the 
  Chairman's decision to reduce the degree of accommodation in reserve 
  markets slightly further at this time rather than to await the next 
  regularly scheduled meeting in mid-May. Some members expressed the 
  view that an increase in the discount rate would provide a desirable 
  supplement to this policy action.
